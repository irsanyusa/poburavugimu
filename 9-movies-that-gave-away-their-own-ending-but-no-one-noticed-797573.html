But be&nbsp;careful, if&nbsp;you haven’t watched these films, you may run into a&nbsp;spoiler. And like always, at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, you’ll find a&nbsp;small bonus&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you remember Belle from Beauty and the Beast, you might be&nbsp;surprised to&nbsp;find out that there’s a&nbsp;reason why she’s wearing a&nbsp;blue dress.</p><p><h2>1. Us, 2019</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2c/bfb/53498e5bd6ba6b16c256b127fe.jpg><p>Doppelgängers appear on&nbsp;the <a href=#>screen</a> exactly at&nbsp;the moment when Adelaide notices the time on&nbsp;the clock&nbsp;— 11:11. But an&nbsp;attentive viewer might notice these <a href=#>numbers</a> before this obvious clue, when they were shown either explicitly or&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>hidden</a> way:</p><ul><li>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the first scenes, Adelaide chooses a&nbsp;T-shirt with the number “11” at&nbsp;a&nbsp;market as&nbsp;a&nbsp;birthday present.</li><li>The same character meets a&nbsp;man at&nbsp;the beach with a&nbsp;sign in&nbsp;his hands. And the sign says, “Jeremiah, 11:11.” This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reference to&nbsp;the Bible. The precise quote&nbsp;is, “I&nbsp;am about to&nbsp;bring upon them a&nbsp;disaster that they cannot escape. They will cry out to&nbsp;Me, but&nbsp;I will not listen to&nbsp;them.” At&nbsp;this time, we&nbsp;can predict that the characters will face something they won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;handle.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/59d/806/f3023959af84d58cb13713f4c4.jpg><p>This number appears throughout the whole film:</p><ul><li>When doppelgängers appear in&nbsp;the city, one of&nbsp;them has “11:11” carved into their forehead.</li><li>When the family of&nbsp;the main characters watches the news about doppelgängers, their&nbsp;TV broadcasts it&nbsp;on&nbsp;channel 11.</li><li>Even ordinary objects can hide this number. For example, scissors consist of&nbsp;2&nbsp;blades that are mirrored (another hint about doppelgängers), so&nbsp;they remind&nbsp;us of&nbsp;the number 11.</li><li>The same thing is&nbsp;applicable to&nbsp;the main character’s T-shirt. At&nbsp;first sight, the “H” symbol looks like the number “11.” And the print on&nbsp;Adelaide’s clothing has <a href=#>another</a> meaning: “Thỏ” translates to&nbsp;“rabbit,” and this animal is&nbsp;yet another important symbol in&nbsp;this movie.</li></ul><p><h2>2. The Shining, 1980</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f4/dab/b4de76529dbddbcea3faa763ff.jpg><p><a href=#>The Shining</a> fans still are desperately trying to&nbsp;prove that the Overlook Hotel that was shown in&nbsp;the film is&nbsp;smaller inside than it&nbsp;seems from the outside. They even draw charts and floor plans comparing its exterior and interior.</p><p>However, there’s an&nbsp;<a href=#>assumption</a> that <a href=#>Stanley Kubrick</a> deliberately distorted the physical perception of&nbsp;the Overlook Hotel to&nbsp;show that the main character, Jack Torrance, is&nbsp;slowly but inevitably going crazy. Some viewers could figure out his madness long before it&nbsp;became obvious.</p><p><h2>3. The Departed, 2006</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d06/d4b/0ccab552d0815d8a06fcb5086f.jpg><p><a href=#>Martin Scorsese</a> <a href=#>used</a> the symbol of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cross in&nbsp;the Oscar-winning movie <a href=#>The Departed</a>. Every time you see something that looks like a&nbsp;cross, you can be&nbsp;sure that something bloody will follow soon. A&nbsp;similar trick was used in&nbsp;The Godfather, but in&nbsp;this movie, <a href=#>oranges</a> appear on&nbsp;the screen before the death of&nbsp;another character.</p><p>And the movie where this trick was used for the first time is&nbsp;<a href=#>Scarface</a> that was released in&nbsp;1932. The director of&nbsp;this movie also used the symbol of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cross.</p><p><h2>4. The Thing, 1982</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8d9/37e/540f47576ba367d088c47a4fd9.jpg><p>Do&nbsp;you remember the opening scene at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the <a href=#>film</a>? A&nbsp;helicopter with foreign scientists follows a&nbsp;dog and lands near a&nbsp;station with the main characters. One of&nbsp;the passengers shouts something and shoots.</p><p>So&nbsp;this <a href=#>shouting</a> was a&nbsp;phrase in&nbsp;the Norwegian language. And the scientist shouted, “Get the hell away! That’s not a&nbsp;dog, it’s some sort of&nbsp;thing! It’s imitating a&nbsp;dog, it&nbsp;isn’t real! GET AWAY YOU IDIOTS!!” We&nbsp;wonder what people who speak Norwegian felt when they were watching this scene.</p><p><h2>5. Total Recall, 1990</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e3/c16/fd4a9858db93feafbc61662d30.jpg><p>After watching this iconic <a href=#>movie</a>, some viewers were sure that the happy ending was real, while others thought that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;special dream-program. And they were right.</p><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the film, the main character, Douglas Quaid, visits the Rekall Company. The company’s employee <a href=#>reads</a> the name of&nbsp;the program out loud that is&nbsp;transplanted into the character’s memory saying, “That’s a&nbsp;new one. Blue sky on&nbsp;Mars.”</p><p>Now, let’s remember the final scene of&nbsp;the movie&nbsp;— the atmosphere of&nbsp;the mysterious Red Planet has cleared, and the sky is&nbsp;turning blue.</p><p><h2>6. The Silence of&nbsp;the Lambs, 1991</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b8/236/81bb2a52e3a3afce26556489ad.jpg><p>During the first conversation with Clarice, Dr. Lecter <a href=#>mentions</a> that he&nbsp;ate liver with fava beans and a&nbsp;good chianti. And this was not just a&nbsp;threat, but also a&nbsp;message to&nbsp;the viewer.</p><p>The novel that became the basis for the <a href=#>film</a> reveals that dangerous and mentally unstable criminals must take a&nbsp;medicine that contains monoamine oxidase inhibitors. And these pills are completely incompatible with liver, beans, and wine.</p><p>There’s an&nbsp;<a href=#>assumption</a> that Lecter hinted to&nbsp;Clarice and the viewers, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very sly way, that he&nbsp;doesn’t take his medicine anymore and is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;escape, which is&nbsp;what he&nbsp;did in&nbsp;the end.</p><p><h2>7. Saw, 2004</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5cc/978/9b63ba542489f44dfe2c18c79f.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the <a href=#>film</a>, the viewers see John Kramer at&nbsp;the hospital for just a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;seconds. Of&nbsp;course, a&nbsp;few people <a href=#>noticed</a> a&nbsp;drawing in&nbsp;the right corner. But this drawing shows one of&nbsp;the deadly traps that was developed for the victims by&nbsp;the main antagonist. This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the obvious hints from the director about the person who is&nbsp;the main villain in&nbsp;the movie.</p><p><h2>8. The Truman Show, 1998</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b2a/e88/8505e050f1a29d39908bae2932.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the first scenes, a&nbsp;small bottle with a&nbsp;“Vitamin&nbsp;D” label appears on&nbsp;the screen for a&nbsp;short time. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>hint</a> for an&nbsp;attentive viewer&nbsp;— people take this vitamin if&nbsp;they don’t spend enough time in&nbsp;the sun. And in&nbsp;<a href=#>The Truman Show</a>, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;discover later, everything is&nbsp;fake, including the sunlight.</p><p><h2>9. Shutter Island, 2010</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/672/854/0c192550c3bd6369cf8a9404f0.jpg><p>There’s a&nbsp;small but extremely important <a href=#>moment</a> that helps the viewer understand the <a href=#>plot</a>. A&nbsp;patient asks for a&nbsp;glass of&nbsp;water during her conversation with a&nbsp;detective. And when the woman drinks&nbsp;it, the glass in&nbsp;her hand suddenly disappears.</p><p>And the main character of&nbsp;the film, Teddy Daniels, hates water because he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;negative memories connected to&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;the glass that disappeared is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tribute to&nbsp;his mental condition. It’s like he’s breaking reality and changing it&nbsp;to&nbsp;not see the thing he&nbsp;hates once again.</p><p>We&nbsp;watch this scene from his perspective, and this is&nbsp;another hint about the character’s mental state, to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;mildly. This is&nbsp;no&nbsp;surprise, because Martin Scorsese is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real genius when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;Easter eggs in&nbsp;movies, and his films rarely lack them.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Beauty and the Beast, 1991</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42d/7e1/529483565eb59508bf6d98db3d.jpg><p><a href=#>Disney</a> gracefully helped Belle <a href=#>stand out</a> among the other characters, giving the audience a&nbsp;hint that this character is&nbsp;special. No, Disney didn’t make her insanely beautiful, clever, or&nbsp;anything else. They simply dressed her in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright blue outfit. No&nbsp;one from her village wears clothes that are this color. The only other character who wears blue, later in&nbsp;the movie, is&nbsp;the Beast.</p><p>Have you ever noticed any hints like these in&nbsp;your favorite movies?
