I want it to happen.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The show, which was written by McTighe and Charlotte Wolf, launched last spring after a long gestation period and a production schedule beleagured by COVID. McTighe also exec produced the show alongside Serena Thompson for Sky Studios and Julian Stevens.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The first season also starred Nenda Neururer (“A Brief History of Struggle”), Solly McLeod (“Boxing Day”), Daniel Ings (“I Hate Suzie”), Emily Taaffe (“Rare Beasts”), Alex Lanipekun (“Spooks”) and Robyn Cara (“Ackley Bridge”).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sky declined to comment for this story.
