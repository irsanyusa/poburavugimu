The former NFL All-Pro is now gearing up for Dancing With The Stars as one of the celebrity contestants of season 32.</strong></p><p>From the football field to the ballroom, Peterson’s participation on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With The Stars</a> is an unexpected career transition. Nonetheless, we expect his athleticism to aid in his experience in the competition. With that, let us get to know more about this illustrious running back.</p><p>Widely deemed as one of the best running backs in football history, Peterson is a remarkable athlete across generations. He rose to popularity at the University of Oklahoma, known for his powerful footwork during games.</p><p>He became seventh overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings and was named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in his first season. Over the course of his playing career, he successfully secured impressive records, an NFL MVP Award, and Pro Bowl selections.</p><p>On Wednesday, it was revealed that Peterson is part of the new cast of Dancing With The Stars season 32. He will compete alongside pro <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Britt Stewart</a> who is the first Black female pro on DWTS.</p><p>It’s very evident that Peterson is all ready to explore a new league. As he competes against a varied set of contestants, fans will witness where his determination and talent can take him. Ahead of Adrian, NFL players have done an amazing job on DWTS. Emmitt Smith, Hines Ward, Donald Driver and Rashad Jennings were all previous winners of the series.</p><p>If you want to witness Peterson’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> journey, be sure to tune in on the competition. The show premieres Tuesday, Sept. 26, on ABC and Disney+.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-shame-dwts-producers-for-casting-him-on-the-show>Fans Shame DWTS Producers for Casting Him on the Show</h2><p>Season 32 has not even kicked off yet, but several fans have already <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">objected against</a> Peterson’s participation on the show. Now, fans are bringing up his history on domestic violence and child abuse.</p><p>“We love you @brittbenae and we are so ready for you to get that mirrorball, but a known child abuser/DV?” one person wrote. “No way can I vote for you this year and support him.”</p><p>“You deserved better Britt wish I could vote for you,” another person commented.</p><p>Several DWTS fans are putting the blame on the series’ producers.</p><p>For those who may not know, in 2014, the former Minnesota Vikings player faced a child abuse charge. Peterson had been accused of causing injury to his son after spanking him with a wooden switch or tree branch. Furthermore, according to records, the boy suffered cuts, marks, and bruises to his thighs.</p><p>Years after this issue, authorities arrested Peterson for domestic violence after an alleged incident with his wife, Ashley Peterson. He was arrested when it was determined that Ashley had sustained a small mark from the incident.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_HarryJowsey_ABCAndrew-Eccles-220x147.jpeg alt="Everything to Know About ‘DWTS’ Celebrity Harry Jowsey" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGmZqGjYrG4wNJmqp6Zo6S7bn%2BRZpqepJWXv6rA2GaYnaqZlrtuvMStnKurn6N8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
