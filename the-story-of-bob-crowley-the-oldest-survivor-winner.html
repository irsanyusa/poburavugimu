Gabon was the seventeenth season of Survivor, and the season featured twists including Exile Island, a schoolyard pick for tribes, two tribe swaps, and a delayed merge.</p><p>After the merge, Bob won three straight immunity challenges, and he made it to the Final Three after beating Matty Whitmore in a fire-making challenge. He was known for his subtle gameplay, kind nature, and close relationship with his ally Sugar Kiper.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Bob went on to win the season in a 4-3-0 vote against Susie Smith and Sugar. He also won the Sprint Player of the Season award at the reunion show, making him the <a href=# id=1e6caf3f-1c26-3e0c-aa61-0ae3a10c7c2d>first contestant</a> to win the million dollar prize and the Fan Favorite Award in the same season.</p><p>Bob is also known for making two extremely convincing immunity idols. He gave one to Randy Bailey, who played it and ended up going home, and the other was made in order to save his alliance member, <a href=# id=6bf0eadd-a82f-3de6-af43-a7e4622413d8>Corinne Kaplan</a> , although she ultimately ended up going home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cMDHnmSsrJ%2Bnxm67xWaZqJpdmL%2Bww8uesGasmJp6sLjDnqqtZaOqv7e11aipZq%2BZo7umvo6db2ygqK%2B0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
