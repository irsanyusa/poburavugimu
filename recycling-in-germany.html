According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 data from the World Economic Forum</a>, the country manages to recycle up to 56% of its waste, which represents the highest recycling rate in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>So, how does Germany manage to recycle so much of its waste so effectively? To a newcomer, the system may seem complex and puzzling. With up to seven different bins, you may be at a loss as to how to sort and recycle even the most common items. In this guide, we’ll review everything you need to know to become a recycling champion in Germany.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=A-quick-breakdown-of-German-recycling-bins>A quick breakdown of German recycling bins</h2><p>As a pioneer in protecting the environment, Germany has developed an extensive recycling system. Different bins, each with its own <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">color</a>, are available to sort rubbish according to their category. In total, there are seven different types of bins:&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Die blaue Tonne</h3><p>Paper and cardboard items go into the <strong>blue</strong> bin (die blaue Tonne). You’ll simply need to flatten boxes and packages before throwing them away.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Die Wertstofftonne</h3><p>The <strong>yellow or orange</strong> bin (die Wertstofftonne) is reserved for other packaging in plastic, metal or mixed materials, such as bread bags with plastic windows. Make sure to rinse the containers to reduce unpleasant odors and facilitate the recycling process.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Das Glas</h3><p>Glass items, such as bottles and jars, that are not returnable or for which you did not pay a Pfand (deposit) at the store, can go into three different bins: a <strong>brown</strong> bin for Braunglas (brown glass), a <strong>white</strong> bin for Weißglas (clear glass) and a <strong>green</strong> bin for Grünglas (green glass). Note that you may not have a waste glass container at your house or apartment building, but you should be able to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">find a glass container nearby</a>.</p><p>Containers bearing the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grüner Punkt</a> (green dot) logo are meant for the yellow, orange or green bin, depending on their material. The logo is there to signal that the manufacturer has paid for the relevant container to be recycled. The more packaging, the higher the fee the manufacturer has to pay. This clever and effective initiative has encouraged manufacturers to significantly reduce their use of paper, glass, metal and cardboard packaging.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Der Biomüll</h3><p><strong>Brown</strong> (or sometimes green) bins are meant for biodegradable waste (Biomüll). This category includes garden waste as well as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">food waste</a>, such as egg shells, vegetable peelings and spent coffee grounds.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Der Restmüll</h3><p>Other household waste items (Restmüll) that are not recyclable — such as sanitary products, nappies and textiles, to name a few — go into the <strong>gray bin</strong>.</p><p>Aside from this useful bin system, Germany has come up with other initiatives to encourage and facilitate recycling.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-Pfand-system-in-Germany>The Pfand system in Germany</h2><p>We’ve already mentioned the Pfand (deposit) system, a scheme aimed at encouraging customers to return specific containers for money.&nbsp;</p><p>If you buy a product in a glass or plastic container with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pfand symbol</a>, you automatically pay a deposit for said container at checkout. You can get your money back upon returning the empty item. At certain small shops and kiosks, you can simply give back the bottles to the clerk in order to be refunded. In bigger <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German supermarkets</a>, you can go to the Pfand machines to return your Pfandflaschen (deposit bottles). After you have deposited all your bottles into the machine, simply press the green button to get a receipt with the total refund amount. Then, at the checkout, hand over the receipt for the amount to be deducted from your grocery bill. The Pfand system allows you to return bottles to any participating store.</p><p>If a container has the label Pfandfrei (deposit free), it’s not included in the Pfand scheme. This means it’s your responsibility to throw it away in the relevant bin (see above).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Alternative-ways-to-reduce-waste-and-recycle-in-Germany->Alternative ways to reduce waste and recycle in Germany&nbsp;</h2><p>There are many items that can’t go into a German recycling bin, either because they are too big or because they don’t fall into any of the accepted categories. Examples of these items include batteries, electronic items and furniture. You can dispose of such Spermüll (bulky waste) at a designated Recyclinghof (recycling center), where you’ll find several containers appropriate for different items. In case of doubt, the staff can guide you to the relevant container for your rubbish.</p><p>Hazardous waste — such as acids, insecticides, disinfectants, corrosives and emptied cans of paint — cannot go into any of the typical recycling bins, either. To dispose of such items, look out for a notice from your local council informing you when and where the truck will come for collection.</p><p>Another way to reduce waste is to offer a second life to your unwanted items. If you’re getting rid of clothes, shoes or knick-knacks in good condition, you may consider donating them or selling them at a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German flea market</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Don’t waste any time learning the German recycling system</h2><p>From the color system of bins to specific initiatives such as the Pfand and the Grüner Punkt, there’s a strict logic to recycling in Germany. Of course, the steps you must take in order to sort and recycle your different rubbish may be time-consuming. But it’s a small price to pay to help Germany champion recycling and protect the planet.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Anne-Lise-1.jpg><h2>Anne-Lise Vassoille</h2><p>Anne-Lise is a translator and copywriter working for various industries...
