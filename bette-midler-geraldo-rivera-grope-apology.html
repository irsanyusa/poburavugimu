Bette Midler joined the #MeToo campaign on Thursday when the singer tweeted a video interview with Barbara Walters, in which she accused talk show host Geraldo Rivera of groping her in 1970s. In the tweet, Midler says Rivera “has yet to apologize.”
Tomorrow is my birthday. I feel like this video was a gift from the universe to me. Geraldo may have apologized for his tweets supporting Matt Lauer, but he has yet to apologize for this."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There, they allegedly broke two vials of amyl nitrate, pushed them under her nose, and groped her. “I did not offer myself up on the alter of Geraldo Rivera,” she tells Walters. “l’ll tell you the truth if I had known he was going so, twenty years later he was going to wind up a slimy talk show host, I never would have even let him in the room.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Midler posted the video amid recent sexual harassment allegations against the TODAY show host, Matt Lauer, who Rivera defended. Lauer was fired on Wednesday by NBC on Wednesday. Rivera tweeted that the news was “sad,” calling Lauer a “great guy” and claiming that “news is a flirty business.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sad about <a href=#>@MLauer</a> great guy, highly skilled & empathetic w guests & a real gentleman to my family & me.
