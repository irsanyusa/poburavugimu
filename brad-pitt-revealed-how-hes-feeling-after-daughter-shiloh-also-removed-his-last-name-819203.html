He loves his children and misses them. It’s very sad." While Pitt is reported to be finding happiness with his current partner, Ines de Ramon, the separation from his children remains a source of considerable distress. The source notes, "He’s still happy with Ines, but the distance from his children pains him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/146/67b/731c19514ab31c6e624a00e785.jpg><p>On Shiloh's 18th birthday, she filed documents to change her legal name to simply "Shiloh Jolie." This decision marks a significant personal step for Shiloh as she transitions into adulthood. Shiloh’s decision comes in the context of a broader trend within the Jolie-Pitt <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, where other children have also been seen using variations of their names.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d70/1c7/1285a55c8785318966d2b8b113.jpg><p>Charles Sykes/Invision/East News<span>, </span>Cyril Pecquenard/KCS/East News</p><p>The Jolie-Pitt family <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>consists</a> of six children: Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, and twins Knox and Vivienne. The strain within the family has been publicly noted since Jolie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>filed for divorce</a> and sought sole physical custody of the children in 2016. Reports have indicated that this ongoing custody battle has contributed to significant emotional challenges for Pitt.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Vivienne</a>, for instance, has been listed as "Vivienne Jolie" in the Playbill for the musical <i>The Outsiders</i>, which she helped her mother produce. Zahara, too, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>introduced</a> herself as "Zahara Marley Jolie" during a sorority event at Spelman College, signaling a similar shift in how the children choose to identify themselves.</p><p>As the Jolie-Pitt <a href=#>children</a> continue to grow and make personal decisions about their identities, the emotional ramifications for their parents, particularly Pitt, remain significant. While Shiloh’s choice to drop "Pitt" from her name is a personal milestone, it also highlights the broader emotional and relational challenges that have affected the family since the high-profile divorce.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK%2BzrcNmp6KspGK%2FpsLEmqOenF2dvLh5x56qZp6VmrmqusZmmJ%2Bslad6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJiwKm1y6ifZpmcqLxuvsSmpq%2BdlGK1qr%2BMpZisrF2jrq6xjHFocmpgaHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
