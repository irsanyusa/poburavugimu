Few of&nbsp;us know that firemen actually have to&nbsp;save frightened cats down from trees, that their uniform can withstand a&nbsp;direct blow from a&nbsp;flamethrower, and that they also repair pipes, cut metal and don’t like the full moon. Ready to&nbsp;find out why?</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>collected half a&nbsp;dozen little-known facts about how firefighters work&nbsp;— they may change your opinion about this amazing profession. And at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, you’ll learn what dog breed is&nbsp;known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;firefighters.</p><p><h2>13. Their uniform can withstand up&nbsp;to&nbsp;2200°F.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0c/b90/92ea7e5e36a0dc4352d1052b18.jpg><p><h2>12. No&nbsp;mustaches or&nbsp;piercings on&nbsp;the face.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/191/d28/52a2715ed7bb77dbadb1c7f6cf.jpg><p>A&nbsp;firefighter wears an&nbsp;oxygen mask. According to&nbsp;safety regulations, the face shouldn’t have any growths, piercings or&nbsp;hair so&nbsp;that the mask fits tightly.</p><p><h2>11. Nothing can be&nbsp;heard or&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;a&nbsp;burning building.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d8/a07/4687135677b3d2c1bd9259142c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;movies, firefighters can navigate inside a&nbsp;burning building easily, quickly finding the injured and taking off their mask to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;person in&nbsp;need of&nbsp;help. In&nbsp;reality, a&nbsp;firefighter can’t remove their mask because they’ll suffocate from the thick smoke. They also can’t see anything, and the loud crackling of&nbsp;flames doesn’t let them hear any people scream for help.</p><p>The biggest enemy of&nbsp;all firefighters is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>backdraft</a>. It&nbsp;happens when a&nbsp;fire in&nbsp;a&nbsp;closed room extinguishes without getting oxygen but upon opening a&nbsp;door, a&nbsp;blazing explosion of&nbsp;fire releasing hot gases flares&nbsp;up. This phenomenon is&nbsp;shown <a href=#>in&nbsp;the movie, Backdraft</a>.</p><p><h2>10. A&nbsp;firefighter wears 5&nbsp;to&nbsp;30&nbsp;kgs on&nbsp;their body.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/04e/422/0b9e745033a566b80b5fd41646.jpg><p>This figure varies depending on&nbsp;what the uniform is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;and what is&nbsp;included in&nbsp;the outfit. But it&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;denied that firefighters can work only if&nbsp;they are physically fit.</p><p><h2>9. Women have worked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;par with men since the 1800s.</h2></p><p><a href=#>Molly Williams became the first woman in&nbsp;the world</a> to&nbsp;extinguish fires on&nbsp;a&nbsp;par with men as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 19th century. Later, there appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;separate women’s brigades. Truth be&nbsp;told, not every man can cope with this dangerous job so&nbsp;those few women working as&nbsp;firefighters can hardly be&nbsp;labeled the “weaker sex”.</p><p><h2>8. They are ready to&nbsp;help in&nbsp;any situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/dcd/c61/61f83e5f12a094376856859eca.png><p>A&nbsp;firefighter’s work is&nbsp;not limited to&nbsp;fires. These heroes save people when there are floods, earthquakes, manmade disasters, and terrorist acts. They even serve as&nbsp;plumbers, electricians, mechanics, psychologists, and medical workers when it’s necessary in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;provide first aid before the arrival of&nbsp;doctors. In&nbsp;some cases, fire engines even have special equipment and apparatuses to&nbsp;resuscitate unresponsive victims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/390/81a/8d92fe5aa9ab04d3de57df9e45.jpg><p>Sometimes firefighters need an&nbsp;excellent sense of&nbsp;humor and special skills when dealing with kids. This little kid, for example, locked his mom out of&nbsp;the car. She had to&nbsp;call the fire department and they managed to&nbsp;get him out of&nbsp;the car. They are really cool guys!</p><p><h2>7. They rescue animals when there is&nbsp;almost no&nbsp;hope.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8c1/a56/51e177558f9ef9c3654f0c76a8.jpg><p>The fire department gets many emergencies concerning animals who are in&nbsp;trouble. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;cow gets stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;ditch, a&nbsp;dog falls into a&nbsp;well, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat can’t get out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tree or&nbsp;a&nbsp;narrow drainpipe; firefighters will come and do&nbsp;their best to&nbsp;save the them.</p><p>A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;alarms turn out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;false thanks to&nbsp;callers dialing wrong numbers or&nbsp;children fooling around on&nbsp;the phone. But even if&nbsp;false alarms are constantly coming from the same number, firefighters are obligated to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the spot every time because there really could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire one of&nbsp;those times.</p><p><h2>6. Shifts can last for more than 24&nbsp;hours.</h2></p><p>Usually shifts last for 24&nbsp;hours with a&nbsp;break of&nbsp;rest for 48&nbsp;hours or&nbsp;10-12 hours for 3-4 consecutive days. During large fires and other emergencies, firemen can work without having a&nbsp;rest break for more than a&nbsp;day.</p><p><h2>5. They put their uniforms in&nbsp;the closet so&nbsp;that they can put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;within seconds.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e5/edd/ee1e185c158ba8b5302ea21e57.jpg><p>Firefighters fold things together in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that they can hop into their boots and put on&nbsp;their pants within a&nbsp;second, put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;jacket in&nbsp;the next second, and grab their helmet and get into the car. They have only a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;get ready and leave for a&nbsp;call&nbsp;— every second can cost someone their life.</p><p><h2>4. Previously, people in&nbsp;wet clothing would enter buildings to&nbsp;stop fires.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9fd/47b/ca5b455aae9d078aab4d79ac25.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past, Japanese firefighters used a&nbsp;special fire extinguishing technique: they’d go&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>into a&nbsp;burning house in&nbsp;wet clothes</a> in&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;catch fire while destroying the walls to&nbsp;prevent the fire from spreading further. Then they’d wait for the fire to&nbsp;become extinguished. This method allowed a&nbsp;significant reduction of&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;victims and the number of&nbsp;major fires until the end of&nbsp;the nineteenth century.</p><p>Today, water is&nbsp;brought in&nbsp;cars and is&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;last for 5-10&nbsp;minutes. This is&nbsp;enough time to&nbsp;start extinguishing, and then the firefighters find the nearest hydrant or&nbsp;pond that they can pump water out&nbsp;of. Not only are firefighters required to&nbsp;limit the movement of&nbsp;fire but they also try to&nbsp;completely eliminate it&nbsp;as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;possible.</p><p><h2>3. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;house has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;free space and there are almost no&nbsp;doors and walls, it&nbsp;will burn as&nbsp;fast as&nbsp;a&nbsp;match.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33b/0b6/3404f85987b407bf75f5c7df2a.jpg><p>100 years ago it&nbsp;was easier to&nbsp;extinguish fires. In&nbsp;those homes with a&nbsp;large number of&nbsp;rooms, walls and doors helped to&nbsp;stop the fire from spreading so&nbsp;quickly. If&nbsp;the house has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;free space, like many do&nbsp;today, the fire spreads quickly, capturing a&nbsp;large area and is&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;extinguish. Most often, a&nbsp;fire takes place in&nbsp;the kitchen. Approximately two out of&nbsp;three house fire-related deaths occur in&nbsp;houses without a&nbsp;fire alarm.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, firefighters cannot send you to&nbsp;prison if&nbsp;you set fire to&nbsp;the house but instead can be&nbsp;blamed themselves for the damage caused. After the fire is&nbsp;extinguished, the investigators start their work looking for a&nbsp;hotbed of&nbsp;fire and determining the legitimacy of&nbsp;the fire-fighting that went&nbsp;on. If&nbsp;the actions of&nbsp;firefighters caused any damage that could have been avoided, action will be&nbsp;filed in&nbsp;court.</p><p><h2>2. Many fires are extinguished by&nbsp;volunteers rather than professional firefighters.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;many countries, volunteers work in&nbsp;the fire department because the government doesn’t have the money to&nbsp;maintain such a&nbsp;service. For example, in&nbsp;Chile, tens of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;firefighters are volunteers who pay monthly fees and receive special training. They are called <a href=#>Bomberos</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;other countries, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;firefighter, you must have a&nbsp;diploma in&nbsp;higher education or&nbsp;undergo special training.</p><p><h2>1. Is&nbsp;the Dalmatian the offical dog of&nbsp;firefighters?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70a/075/3c0f8e5ff9a9da78c8d878615b.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the past Dalmatians used to&nbsp;run ahead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fire brigade barking and clearing the way for the horses to&nbsp;get through. This breed is&nbsp;distinguished by&nbsp;their fearlessness, quick learning abilities and also the ability to&nbsp;easily find a&nbsp;common language with other animals. They used to&nbsp;live together with draft horses that need some communication in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good shape.</p><p>Today, the Dalmatians are still a&nbsp;standing symbol of&nbsp;firefighters, but dogs of&nbsp;different breeds are usually attracted to&nbsp;the service. Their job is&nbsp;to&nbsp;find people&nbsp;— a&nbsp;dog can find a&nbsp;victim through smell or&nbsp;hearing a&nbsp;call for help when people and technology are deaf, blind and oftentimes powerless.</p><p><h2>Remember that being a&nbsp;firefighter is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;simple profession, but a&nbsp;destiny!</h2></p><p>For many people, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;childhood dream to&nbsp;save lives, help others and challenge dangers. And thanks to&nbsp;such people, we&nbsp;know that every firefighter&nbsp;is, in&nbsp;fact, a&nbsp;real superhero who risks their life and health daily. We&nbsp;thank them for their work!</p><p>Are there any firefighters in&nbsp;your family? Are you aware of&nbsp;other hidden secrets of&nbsp;this profession?
