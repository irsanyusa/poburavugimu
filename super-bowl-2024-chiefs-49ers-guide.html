The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will once again compete in the NFL’s championship match as the two football teams head to Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas on Feb. 11, after each winning their respective conference title games on Sunday.
The Chiefs, who are the reigning Super Bowl champions and won the matchup against the 49ers four years ago, are led by generational quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce, who has lit up both the fields and the tabloids this year thanks to his emphatic performances as well as attention-grabbing relationship with singer and TIME Person of the Year Taylor Swift."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Last year’s Super Bowl was <a href=#>the most watched U.S. telecast ever</a>.

This year, <a href=#>AdWeek reports</a> that the program’s pricey spots are “virtually sold out,” and several companies have already begun releasing previews of their celebrity-studded advertisements to come—from mayonnaise maker Hellmann’s <a href=#>teasing an ad</a> featuring comedian and cat lady Kate McKinnon, to beer brand Michelob Ultra putting soccer star and <a href=#>TIME Athlete of the Year</a> Lionel Messi <a href=#>front</a> and <a href=#>center</a>, to gambling facilitator BetMGM sharing its <a href=#>full 60-second plug</a> that pokes fun at seven-time Super Bowl champ Tom Brady as actor Vince Vaughn declares the recently retired quarterback has “won too much” and should “let others have their turn.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What are the Super Bowl betting odds?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The 49ers are the favorites to win, according to bookmakers, with an opening spread of around 2 points, though that is likely to fluctuate in the run-up to the actual gameday.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Who is performing the 2024 Super Bowl halftime show?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">R&B superstar Usher was announced last September as the headline performer of the Super Bowl halftime show, sponsored by Apple Music.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s an honor of a lifetime to finally check a Super Bowl performance off my bucket list,” the 45-year-old eight-time Grammy winner—who is set to release his ninth album, “Coming Home,” on Feb. 9—said. “I can’t wait to bring the world a show unlike anything else they’ve seen from me before.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the past, celebrity guests have sometimes joined the main act, though none have been officially announced yet. A <a href=#>trailer</a> released in January featured appearances by LeBron James, J Balvin, and BTS’ Jung Kook.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There will also be several performances before the game: country musician Reba McEntire is slated to lead national anthem “The Star-Spangled Banner,” while hip-hop artist Post Malone will offer his rendition of “America the Beautiful,” and actress and soul singer Andra Day will perform “Lift Every Voice and Sing”—also known as “<a href=#>the Black national anthem</a>” and which has been included in Super Bowl pregame festivities since 2021.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Will Taylor Swift be at the Super Bowl?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift, who has <a href=#>become a fixture</a> at her boyfriend Kelce’s games and was there to celebrate the Chiefs victory against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday to advance to<strong> </strong>the Super Bowl, has yet to confirm whether or not she’ll be in attendance in Las Vegas on Feb. 11. The global pop star has a scheduled Eras Tour concert in Tokyo on Feb. 10, though social media users have already <a href=#>calculated</a> that she could feasibly still make it back <a href=#>across the world</a> in time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbWhugnSEjqysqZ2iYq%2Bww8tmaWlqZGKwqbXEn6pmbGmav7R5xq6gnZ1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
