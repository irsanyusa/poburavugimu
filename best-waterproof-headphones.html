This design is great for those uncomfortable with in-ear earbuds and need to be aware of the space around them while swimming.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-waterproof-headphones>How we selected the best waterproof headphones</h2><p>There were a number of key points that I noted while testing and researching to find the best waterproof earbuds and headphones available today. Some of my most important considerations included each gadget’s Ingress Protection (IP) rating or degree of how waterproof it is, audio quality, comfort, battery life, list of features, and price.</p><h2 id=what-you-should-know-about-waterproof-headphones>What you should know about waterproof headphones</h2><h3>Level of water resistance</h3><p>Just because headphones or earbuds are labeled as “waterproof,” doesn’t mean that they are necessarily the level of waterproof required for your daily activities. Waterproof headphones are graded with the Ingress Protection system, and it’s easy to check how waterproof they are at a glance if you know what you’re looking for. The first digit after “IP” notes how dustproof it is, while the second digit signifies how resilient the device is to water exposure.</p><p>Earbuds rated “IPX7” will survive being underwater for 30 minutes at a depth of up to 1 meter, for example, while headphones with an “IPX8” rating are practically waterproof and made for activities such as swimming and surfing. Please refer to the exact level of claimed waterproofing by the manufacturer for the suggested limitations of any waterproof headphones before you buy, to make sure they are the right fit for your water-related activities.</p><h3>Comfort</h3><p>Active people who need the durability of waterproof headphones also need them to be both comfortable and secure on or in their ears during their swimming, kayaking, or other adventures. If a cozy fit tops your list of “must haves,” but you’re having a tough time considering the dilemma of “<a rel=alternate href=#>earbuds vs. headphones</a>” in regards to overall comfort, keep an eye out for earbuds with swappable in-ear silicone tips, customization features such as flexible over-the-ear hooks for the perfect fit for your ear shape, or consider bone conducting headphones that sit on your head like sunglasses without probing into your ear canal.</p><h3>Battery life</h3><p>There is no universal “best battery life” for a set of waterproof headphones, just the best battery life for how you intend to use them. For example, a pair of waterproof earbuds with a sizable 32-hour battery life is perfect for people who visit the gym every day or run regularly, as it allows them to go for days at a time without charging. On the other hand, a specialized waterproof headset specifically designed for swimming with an eight-hour battery life may seem poor at a glance, but since few people swim for more than eight hours at a time, this smaller battery life works fine as long as you remember to place it on the charger between uses.</p><h3>Additional features</h3><p>Each pair of waterproof earbuds or headphones has its own unique perks, such as a premium sound quality with a deep bass, suitably loud yet clear volume, and multiple microphones for pitch-perfect phone calls, a quick-charging feature, an integrated MP3 player, and on-ear controls.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do waterproof headphones work?</h3><p>Absolutely! Headphones and earbuds rated IPX7 or IPX8 by the Ingress Protection code are considered to be waterproof, and they allow wearers to safely submerge their device for a certain amount of time underwater. These models are easily your best option for listening to your tunes while you’re exercising in the pool or having fun at the beach.</p><p>Note that IPX7-rated headphones will survive being submerged in up to one meter of water for up to 30 minutes, and while the exact waterproof specifications of models sporting the superior IPX8 rating will vary between manufacturers, these headphones are generally safe underwater between one and three meters deep and for over 30 minutes at a time. There is an IXP9 rating, however these devices are designed to survive extreme conditions and are rarely offered as consumer products.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that if you need earbuds or headphones for swimming, look for models with either integrated memory or a radio transmitter, as Bluetooth signals do not reliably work underwater.</p><h3>What's the difference between waterproof and water resistant?</h3><p>The difference between “waterproof” and “water resistant” is simple but extremely important: Waterproof earbuds or earphones are designed to be watertight and able to be submerged underwater without being damaged, while water-resistant models will shrug off a little moisture but cannot be safely brought into the pool. Waterproof headphones are noted by an IP rating of either IPX7 or IPX8, making them perfect for swimming.</p><p>While not capable of surviving a trip in the deep end, water-resistant earbuds and headsets are perfectly suited for worry-free jogging in all wet and humid conditions, sweating up a storm in the gym, or even taking a shower while enjoying a podcast. Headphones that carry an IPX4, IPX5, or IPX6 rating are water resistant, and IPX7 and IPX8 rated models are waterproof.</p><h3>Are swimming headphones worth it?</h3><p>For anyone who spends a lot of time swimming, exercising in the pool, or enjoying water sports like surfing, a pair of waterproof swimming headphones is absolutely worth it for listening to your favorite music, radio stations, audiobooks, and podcasts while you’re working out or having fun outside.</p><p>Whether you need a set of quality swimming headphones for entertainment or staying focused throughout your exercise, the best models are completely waterproof (with an IPX7 or IPX8 rating), sport a battery life that will last throughout your swim, feature plenty of digital storage space for your top tracks, and a sharp sound quality for consistently crisp and clear audio.</p><h3>Which headphones are most waterproof?</h3><p>Headphones labeled with an IPX8 rating are the most waterproof options on the market. Models with an IPX7 rating are still considered waterproof, but to a lesser extent, and earbuds with an IPX6, IPX5, and IPX4 rating are water resistant.</p><h3>Are there 100% waterproof earbuds?</h3><p>Yes, and some of them, such as the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sony NW-WS413 Waterproof Sports Wearable MP3 Player</a> and <a rel=nofollow href=#>H2O Audio Multi-Sport Waterproof Headphones</a> made my list of the best waterproof headphones available today!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lp5bBpr7Pq6aonl2dsqKwz6Gmp52jZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
