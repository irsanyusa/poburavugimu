Hamlet revenge quotes are probably among the most common of Shakespeare's sayings. He seems to capture the revenge theme perfectly, portraying the depth of revenge through the relationships and exchanges between the characters in his stories.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8447479bb8ed6bd7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kukah urges religious leaders not to grovel before politicians</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, you need to apply wit, and probably get familiar with his style of writing to truly understand the depth of what he means. The following Hamlet quotes about revenge will leave you with something to think about. You may also get to answer the question, 'was Hamlet successful in his revenge?'</p><ul><li>How all occasions do inform against me, and spur my dull revenge.</li></ul><p class=align-left>This is a soliloquy from Act 4 scene 4. In this case, Hamlet is looking at the world and how everything around him points out how wrong his actions are. The aim is to inform against, which literally means to accuse.</p><ul><li>Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: A fellow of infinite jest.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The phrase tells us that Hamlet is contemplating the temporary nature of life, as he looks at Yorick's skull. It also implies that, though Hamlet seems to have gone mad, actually he is speaking highly meaningful sentences with Yorick.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/16bf19d6905c7dff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Inspiring Prince quotes and lyrics about love, life and music</span></p></a><ul><li>I must be cruel only to be kind; thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The context of the quote is crucial. Hamlet realizes that the person he killed was Polonius. He spoke those words above. It is obvious that Hamlet felt guilty when he realized he murdered the wrong person.</p><ul><li>There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.</li></ul><p class=align-left>It means that the absence of complete information leads us to believe that “things” are either good or bad when we try to think about something. It could also mean that the absence of complete information leads us to believe that “things” are either good or bad when we try to think about something</p><h3>Hamlet quotes on love</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/27859ab9c3df5537.png><p class=align-left>Love was Shakespeare's specialty, and Hamlet is one of the books he captured this theme perfectly. Below are excellent quotes showing the same.</p><ul><li>I loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers could not, with all their quantity of love, make up my sum.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/67acf19dc6fe9ea3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ great sibling quotes to share with your brothers and sisters</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The quote from act 5 captures several things. It heavily displays the theme of indecision that progresses throughout the play in Hamlet's life. It also captures the point where Hamlet directly challenges Laertes, bringing us later to the duel, and where the play ends. It is also an example of insanity throughout the play. In the beginning, we know that Hamlet says he is going to pretend like he is crazy, however at this point his sanity is genuinely questioned by the spectators. His actions have quite literally drawn this woman that he supposedly loves to commit suіcide. Instead of properly mourning or accepting his faults, he has a pіssing contest with Laertes over "who loved her most".</p><ul><li>This is the very еcstasy of love. Whose violent property foredoes itself,. And leads the will to desperate undertakings. - Act II, scene 1, line 102.</li><li>Doubt thou the stars are fire. Doubt that the sun doth move. Doubt truth to be a liar. But never doubt I love. - Act II, Scene 2, line 115.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f77142e2a0ad4a03.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Memorable Ram Dass quotes on love, death, fear, aging, and healing</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is possible that a semantic ambiguity arises in the poem if Shakespeare used the word "doubt" to imply "suspect". Hamlet's love poem, then, would ask Ophelia to go ahead and suspect all proven forces of the universe but “never suspect that he loves her.</p><ul><li>Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; when little fears grow great, great love grows there. - Act III, scene 2, line 181.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Love wins and dispels all forms of doubts and fear.</p><ul><li>A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind. A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound. - Act IV, scene 3, line 334.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Lovers tend to be most alert when they are truly in love.</p><ul><li>You cannot call it love, for at your age the heyday in the blood is tame. – Act 3, Scene 4</li></ul><p class=align-left>Hamlet means that Gertrude could not have married Claudius out of love, because at her age, sexual desire ("the heyday in the blood") has gone away, "humble" with advancing age. So because Claudius is nowhere near the man King Hamlet was, and Gertrude's sеx drive should be gone anyway, there must be some other reason why she chose to marry this man, who, Hamlet reveals to his mother, is guilty of the murder of his father.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a7e0c5d7f2aa8d88.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cool Walt Whitman quotes on love, nature and the meaning of life</span></p></a><ul><li>Love is begun by time, And time qualifies the spark and fire of it. – Act 4, Scene 7</li></ul><p class=align-left>Time makes love grow stronger.</p><h3>Hamlet quotes on madness</h3><p class=align-left>If you have read the story, then you probably asked yourself at some point, 'does Hamlet really go mad?' Well, the following Hamlet madness quotes will give you more insight into the story's theme of madness. These also some of the quotes from Hamlet that need a deep understanding to truly appreciate their meaning. They include:</p><ul><li>"That I essentially am not in madness/ But mad in craft.</li></ul><p class=align-left>In this case, Hamlet admits to his mother, Gertrude, that his madness is not genuine, and is instead a form of craft. It is a cunning form of pretense. It further suggests his sanity.</p><ul><li>I am but mad north-north-west</li></ul><p class=align-left>Addressing the Guildenstern, he suggests that his madness is only active when it is necessary. It also suggests that he is nearing actual madness. This is means that he is on the verge of becoming truly mad and may not know the difference between sanity and insanity.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8f53466892eff4e5.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Zen quotes that will keep you calm and peaceful</span></p></a><ul><li>Fishmonger</li></ul><p class=align-left>To understand this quote, context is key. Modern audiences would understand it best as Hamlet calling Polonius a ‘fishmonger’ being indicative of him having successfully feigned an ‘antic disposition. For this reason, they are likely to consider it a humorous comment. On the other hand, contemporary audiences will interpret the fishmonger epithet works on different of levels. First, a fishmonger was considered to be a womanizer. Second, a fishmonger was thought to be not only sеxually lascivious but to cause others to be the same.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/24915bea936a3797.jpg><p class=align-left>Apart from the quotes above, you may also want to note a few other popular Polonius quotes. These includes:</p><ul><li>Brevity is the soul of wit.</li></ul><p class=align-left>It means that the essence of a witty statement lies in its concise wording and delivery.</p><ul><li>Method in the madness.</li></ul><p class=align-left>It means that there is always a purpose in doing something that is seemingly crazy. There is a reason for someone's strange behavior, and there is a plan behind the odd behavior of a person.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/579e939c7c1d0dd7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing Oscar Wilde quotes that every literary fan should know</span></p></a><ul><li>More matter with less art.</li><li>Neither a borrower nor a lender be.</li></ul><p class=align-left>It means do not lend or borrow money from a friend because if you do so, you will lose both your friend and your money</p><ul><li>To thine own self be true.</li></ul><p class=align-left>It has three meanings. The first meaning is that someone can better judge himself if he has done what he should or could have done. Secondly, it means that one must be honest in his ways and relations. The third meaning is that one must always do the right thing.</p><p class=align-left>The above Hamlet quotes will teach you a thing or two about Shakespeare's style of writing. He was not only intriguing, but he had a way of playing with words to hide meaning while at the same time pass a message.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnR9l3JubGViZXqnrcyorKxlmJa6rbHTZqiup6SawG6%2BxK%2Bcp5%2BVYrmwwsRmpJqcnprAtHnRnq2eppeae6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
