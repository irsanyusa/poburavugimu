"But I am insanely excited to announce that I am Victoria's Secret's newest ANGEL!"</p><p>While being a Victoria's Secret model is considered an honor in-and-of itself, being an Angel comes with a whole new set of responsibilities.

It's also believed that Angels must have some history with the brand before landing the role.</p><p>Representatives for Anderson did not immediately reply to INSIDER's request for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8yenK1lnJq8rrXEZpinnJWnwLC6jK2fnmWmnrC1u9GimKxlo5qws7HTZqquqJWnurCwxKVksKCfYre2v9NmmZ6bkaKybsDHnmSbqpGjsbR5xaKprKxfrL2nuZipZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
