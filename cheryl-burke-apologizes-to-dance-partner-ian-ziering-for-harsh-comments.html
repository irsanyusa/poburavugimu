On her podcast, Pretty Messed Up with cohost AJ McLean of The <strong>Backstreet Boys</strong>, she apologized to the Sharknado actor for going on a rant in 2016 about how he was her “least favorite” partner.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cheryl-burke-apologizes-to-former-dance-partner-ian-ziering>Cheryl Burke Apologizes to Former Dance Partner Ian Ziering</h2><p>Burke and Ziering competed on Dancing With The Stars in 2007. The duo landed in fourth place and it wasn’t until nine years later that Burke opened up on the&nbsp;Allegedly&nbsp;podcast about despising this partnership.</p><p>“It made me want to slit my wrists,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she said in 2016.</a> “I was, like, crying to the executives. I was like, ‘Is there any way to please just eliminate us?’ They’re like, ‘We can’t. We can’t do that.’ And I swear, every time I asked, we just kept going. We would last till the end.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>At the time, Burke apologized for seeming to make light of suicide. Now, she is apologizing for how hurtful her comments were for Ziering.</p><p>“The one thing that I feel like I truly regret and I want to&nbsp;make amends&nbsp;with is Ian Ziering,” she said during her recent podcast.&nbsp;“I was completely out of line a few years ago. I did a podcast where they were asking me who my favorite partner was and who did I hate the most. I answered Ian Ziering, and I said something along the lines of ‘I’d rather slit my wrists than dance with Ian Ziering again.'”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FORMER ‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ CONTESTANTS EXPOSE JUDGES FOR THIS…</a></strong></p><p>“I know it hurt him, and I know it hurt his family. It was a big deal,” she continued. “I’m here to say sorry.&nbsp;I truly am so sorry for being so inconsiderate and just talking, trying to basically get a reaction and putting him as my punching bag, really.”</p><p>Burke also mentioned that she knows her comments had a huge impact on Ziering. She said she is aware of a conversation about the whole situation between Ziering and Dancing With The Stars pro, Tony Dovolani.</p><p>“He was explaining to Tony how hurt he was and he didn’t understand because he thought we were good,” she said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>In her book, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing Lessons: How I Found Passion and Potential on the Dance Floor and in Life</a>, Burke talks positively about being partners with Ziering. But now she says she truly regrets her harsh comments from the interview.</p><p>“I even wrote great things about Ian Ziering in the book I wrote a long time ago,” she said.&nbsp;“It must’ve come out of left field for him a little bit… I lost a lot of respect for myself when I said that. It haunts me till this day.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> TYRA BANKS FINALLY RESPONDS TO ‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ HATE</a></strong></p><p>Burke participated in 23 seasons of Dancing With The Stars and won the coveted mirror ball trophy twice.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Just-Sam-American-Idol-The-Comeback-Arthur-Gunn-Faith-Becnel-Laine-Hardy.jpeg alt="Why Hasn’t Just Sam Performed this Season on ‘American Idol’?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Cheryl Burke</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGcq7GcYq%2B2vsqeZJqon6G8qLXZnqpmrJ9isaK6wp5kqZmiqbumvoyimKdlqp6ys7XNoGSfp6JitaK%2B0qFknKedorKvwNJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
