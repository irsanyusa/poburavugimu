Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.” This verse reminds us that God is the source which is why we should submit and rely on Him.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>1 John 4:4—</h3></p><p>“You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” This is a reminder that what we carry always outweighs whatever the Devil would try to. It should serve as a source of comfort.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>Luke 10:19—</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.”</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>2 Chronicles 20:15—</h3></p><p>“This is what the Lord says to you: ‘Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army.

For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” These verses carry all the answers.</p><p>Attacks will come but we should never be scared because God has already conquered the World (See John 16:33).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMCxtdGiq66ZnGLEor7FmqmeZWFleqO1waWcZq6Vp8Cmv4ytpmaglaG9bsXOrmSwoJWjerSt05qlZpmkqa6kt9JoraWfoaXAcg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
