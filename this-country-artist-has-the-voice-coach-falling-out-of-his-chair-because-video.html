The coaches all fell in love with his country voice and were all vying to have him on their teams. One coach even fell out of his chair after the performance.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-james-dupr-caused-coach-to-fall-out-of-his-chair-during-blind-audition><strong>James Dupré</strong> Caused Coach To Fall Out Of His Chair During Blind Audition</h2><p>As soon as James started singing, all of the coaches were hooked. When it comes to country artists, all eyes are usually on Blake as the audience waits for him to hit his button. Blake’s hand hovered over the button at the beginning of the song. At that moment, Gwen Stefani, Adam Levine and Pharrell Williams all hit their buttons. It all happened so quickly that Blake just sat there hysterically laughing.</p><p>While the three coaches got to watch James command the stage, Blake listening intently. Finally, Blake turned his chair, making this one remarkable four-chair turn. Each coach made a case as to why James should choose to be on their temas. But, nobody wanted to coach him more than Adam. James chose to be on Team Adam which caused him to get out of his chair and fall on the floor in a dramatic fashion.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SINGING DUO ON ‘THE VOICE’ IS SO GOOD, ADAM LEVINE FALLS OUT OF HIS CHAIR [VIDEO]</a></strong></p><p>In The Battle Rounds, James sang “Fortunate Son” against Dustin Monk. He was declared the winner of The Battle and advanced to The Knockouts. He sang Blake’s song “So Cool if You Do,” in The Knockouts against Shelby Brown.</p><p>“James, because you’re so damn good, it’s hard for you to convey the emotion that I know you have,” Adam said after his performance. “The truth of the matter (is)&nbsp;I think that Shelby had this dramatic flair to her song that might have helped her.” James was shockingly eliminated from the competition.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-he-now>Where Is He Now?</h3><p>After appearing on The Voice, James starred in the movie The Price in 2015 with country legend Randy Travis. He was then chosen by Randy and Mary Travis to be a guest vocalist on the 2019 Music of Randy Travis tour.</p><p>In 2020, James released a 12 song album called Home and Away.
