The&nbsp;Insecure&nbsp;star made a splash on the red carpet in shimmering Michael Kors, stepping into her first Met experience with the poise of a seasoned professional. Though Rae isn't one for the party circuit, she admits that big affairs like the Met or awards season can lead to far more than a photo op. “I like going to those things and being like, ‘Ah, so-and-so is cool, I would never have expected to connect with them [otherwise].’ ”</p><p>One such new connection is designer&nbsp;Michael Kors, whose black-and-gold creation Rae brought to life. Though they only met face-to-face the night of the ceremony, their mutual admiration came through in the final look. “For someone who is newer to the spotlight, she has a strong sense of personal style, which I love,” said Kors, who patterned the dress on the Catholicism theme as well as symbolism associated with pre-Christian religions. “Gold has been the color of religious symbols since before the Egyptians. If there’s such a thing as a holy color, it’s got to be gold,” he said. “For this dress, we really played with the ornateness that you find in a lot of religious art and in Catholic churches. Damask is a traditional church fabric, so we re-crafted the pattern with 1.3 million sequins.”</p><p>The 2,060 man-hours required to embroider Rae’s look were a labor of love. “There’s a slight regal,&nbsp;Coming to America&nbsp;vibe—if it was based in Catholicism,” said Rae, referencing the ’80s comedy and its renowned costumes. Prince Akeem may have been missing, but Rae looked like modern royalty. In this video, she takes&nbsp;Vogue&nbsp;along for the ride as she preps, offering a fresh perspective on what it’s like head to the Met.</p><p><strong>Directors: Tari Wariebi & Denzel Deranamie</strong><strong>Sound: Evan DeVitto</strong><strong>Editor: Jesse Threatt</strong><strong>Filmed at The Mark Hotel</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdnnZrBbrPApZhmamBmhW6zxK1kq52RmcZuw8itn2aho6iubr7AnmSfp6Jitaa%2BjJ%2Bgq6ukYrqmwIybmKWkX5%2B%2FecPRnqo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
