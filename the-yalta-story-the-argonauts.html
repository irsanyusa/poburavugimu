Stalin said he “would be delighted.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For months thereafter, Roosevelt and Churchill tried to wriggle out of the Black Sea site.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">F.D.R. to Churchill: “Do you think it is possible to get U.J. [‘Uncle Joe’] to come to Athens or Cyprus?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Churchill to F.D.R.: “I suppose there would be … difficulty in Russian warships coming out of the Black Sea . . . One way would be for Turkey to declare war, which I expect she would be very willing to do. But I am not at all sure that the Russians would welcome this at the present juncture.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">F.D.R. to Churchill: “What do you think of the possibility of our inducing U.J. to meet with us in Piraeus, Salonica or Constantinople?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Churchill to F.D.R.: “I am somewhat attracted by the suggestion of Jerusalem. Here, there are first-class hotels . . . We ought to put the proposition to U.J. and throw on him the onus of refusing. After all, we are respectable people, too.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">F.D.R. to Churchill: “I had hoped that Uncle Joe could come to Rome or Malta or Taormina or Egypt, but if he will not —and insists on the Black Sea—I could do it even at great difficulty . . .”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">F.D.R. to Ambassador Harriman: “I am prepared to go to the Crimea and have the meeting at Yalta . . .”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Churchill to F.D.R.: “Have you a name for this operation? If not, I suggest ‘Argonaut,* which has a local but not deducible association.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Even as the delegations were on the way to Yalta, Harry Hopkins reported to F.D.R. that Churchill “says that if we had spent ten years on research, we could not have found a worse place in the world than Yalta . . .He claims it is good for typhus and deadly lice, which thrive in those parts.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Knowing how important it would be to coordinate U.S.-British views beforehand, Churchill insisted on a meeting at Malta preceding the Yalta Conference. The Prime Minister pointed out that there was much work to be done.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Churchill to F.D.R.: “I do not see any other way of realizing our hopes about world organization in five or six days. Even the Almighty took seven.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When the new Argonauts had their travel plans nearly completed, Churchill cabled Roosevelt: “No more let us falter. From Malta to Yalta. Let nobody alter.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">*Argonaut Leader Jason sailed the Black Sea in quest of the fleece of the golden ram.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vcGhiZ4BwwMeeZLKZnKmubr%2FTqKmyZaSdsm6t0aCmp5mlqcBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
