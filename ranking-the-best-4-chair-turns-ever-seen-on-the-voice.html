Getting one judge is always the goal, but every so often, an aspiring singer comes along whose talent cannot be denied. These singers become a hot commodity once all four chairs turn around. The celebrity judges do their best to convince the contestant on stage to join their team. The banter and pleading makes for grade A television.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-matthew-johnson>Matthew Johnson</h2><p>Matthew appeared on Season 16 of The Voice. His rendition of Kirk Franklin’s “I Smile,” was a refreshing treat for the audience and the judges. Before Matthew finished his first note, Blake Shelton and Adam Levine turned their chairs around. The inspirational song was a fun kick off to the season. Matthew commanded the stage and interacted with the audience, adding his smooth vocals over the choir heavy track. When it was time to choose, Matthew joined Team Legend. The crooner has continued to sing at sports games around the country, most recently he sang the National Anthem during a Patriots game. His latest single “Used” was released last year.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Carson Peters</h2><p>17 year old Carson Peters won over America with his guitar in hand. The country singer performed Don Williams’s “Tulsa Time,” and had the judges on their feet. Once all of the judges turned their chairs around, Carson mentioned that the decision was harder than he thought. Carson was a fiddle player and was heavily influenced by bluegrass. After having a brief mentorship moment with Blake Shelton, Carson chose him, seeing that he would best benefit his musical style. Viewers were shocked when Shelton eliminated Carson after the knockout round. Carson continues to do shows with his band, Iron Mountain. The singer also released his self-titled country EP.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/wPtd6I5Ucgs</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Desz</h2><p>When you choose to audition with a song such as “Un-Break my Heart,” the world will be listening. For<a href=# class=broken_link> Desz</a>, taking on the Toni Braxton classic was the perfect song to showcase her talent. The judges instantly showed their excitement that the song was being covered by a contestant. “This is my jam,” John Legend said. It wasn’t long before all four judges turned to experience Desz’s performance. She picked Team Kelly and dominated Season 19 of the hit show. Desz made it to the Top 5 but fell short of the championship. Many fans felt as though the powerhouse singer was robbed. These days Desz is touring as a member of Kanye West’s Sunday Service Choir.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/S4Yy4V5BM4Y</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Javier Colon</h2><p>Season 1 winner, Javier Colon, set the bar high when he was one of the first contestants to walk on to The Voice stage. Javier was a signed artist with Capitol Records before he was dropped because of creative differences. He showed his perseverance by auditioning for the newest singing competition show in 2011. Javier performed a stripped down version of the Cyndi Lauper hit “Time After Time.” The judges were impressed by his acoustic sound. The last 10 years Javier has continued his music journey. He has released albums, with his 2016 album Gravity being his most recent one. The singer has expressed interest in Broadway, and by the looks of his social media, he is active in his pursuit. Javier is constantly posting covers of Broadway songs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tamara Jade</h2><p>Judges Kelly Clarkson and John Legend turned their chairs around before the beat dropped on Tamara’s rendition of Lizzo’s “Cuz I Love You.” Clarkson showed pure joy as the performance continued. Tamara even managed to make the American Idol Season 1 champion jaw drop. She eventually made it as a semi-finalist before being eliminated. Recently Tamara has been focusing on her health as well as her music. She is a proud independent artist who continues to play shows for eager audiences. She released her debut album, Self Aware, in 2019.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/_HW9zvEIvVE</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kenzie Wheeler</h2><p>An excited Kelly Clarkson shouted “I love your voice,” when Kenzie Wheeler began singing Keith Whitley’s “Don’t Close Your Eyes.” She already blocked fellow judge, Blake Shelton, from competing with her to snag Kenzie. The hopeful singer’s voice was like butter as he leaned into his country roots. Kenzie was the runner up for Season 20. He continues to play shows and release music. In 2021 he had close to 1 million streams for his original music on Spotify. His last album was the 2018 release Dover.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/5bFfeiVrE_I</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Worth The Wait</h2><p>Mama T, Mia, and Jacy are a singing trio who impressed all four judges on Season 19 of The Voice. Mama T stepped in to sing with the group after her other singing daughter had to take care of her special needs child. Gwen Stefani did her best to try and get the group on her team, but ultimately they went with country music king, Blake Shelton. The judges took notice of how well they were able to harmonize Linda Ronstadt’s “When Will I Be Loved.” Worth The Wait made it to the Top 17 but was eliminated. Fans were outraged. The group has been playing small shows and most recently performed at the famous Grand Ole Opry.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/dRbu_Maro9U</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Toneisha Harris</h2><p>Foreigner’s “I Want To Know What Love Is,” is one of the greatest songs ever produced. Toneisha Harris had a lot to live up to when she sang the song during her blind audition on Season 18. Expectations were met when all four judges turned around to witness her greatness. Toneisha was able to make the song her own by giving it an R&B twist. Nick Jonas told the singer he would be “honored” to work with her. Toneisha continued to impress week after week ending her season as the runner-up. Her talent even led Kelly Clarkson and Team Blake to invite her to sing at their shows after the season wrapped. In 2020 Toneisha released her gospel single, “Forgive Me.” She is currently living out her dream playing the iconic role of Motormouth Maybelle on the Hairspray tour.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/Eg1Zan5UA3U</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Todd Tilgham</h2><p>Season 18 winner, Todd Tilghman, became the oldest winner ever of The Voice at 42 years old. The pastor’s rendition of Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band’s “We’ve Got Tonight,” found him jumping on stage from excitement. The judges complimented the raspiness of Todd’s voice. They loved his energy and his story. He easily became the fan favorite to <a href=# class=broken_link>win</a>. Todd continues to put out music. He released a Christmas album in 2021, and he will be releasing his new single “Slow Down,” in February.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/0hDuvlrJ2I8</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Girl Named Tom</h2><p>Season 21 winning trio, Girl Named Tom’s four chair turn around foreshadowed their big win. The judges were on their feet after hearing the sibling’s harmony. Each of the judges did their best to lure the group to their team, but they went with Kelly Clarkson. Throughout the season, the singing trip wowed audiences with their ability to arrange songs in the best of ways. After their win, Girl Named Tom said their album is in the works along with a possible <a href=#>2023 tour</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/BLw3r014dBY</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NUP_193480_0459.jpg alt="Watch the Top 5 Best Kid Magicians on ‘Got Talent’ Who Will Blow Your Mind" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570ZqlpKGenHq1tMRmmZ6rpGKBbq%2FHmqCrZaSqv6%2B%2FjJ6tnqpdqLKmuoyopWasmJp6t7vInJxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
