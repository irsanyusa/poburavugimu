Subsequently, fans started speculating that the song might have been created to slam the football player with his insincerity during their relationship.</p><p>While the music video is a huge tea in general, one scene particularly caught people’s attention. Halfway through it, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shakira</a> can be seen searching for something in the refrigerator, surprisingly seeing Rauw Alejandro’s head inside. This turned out to be an extreme clue on how Shakira found out that Pique was having an affair.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShowNews Today</a>, Shakira answered in one interview that she opened the fridge “to find the truth.” Furthermore, the singer explained that there was one strawberry jam that only she in the family loved to eat. However, when she came home after travelling for work, she realized that someone had eaten her jam. Since Pique reportedly hates this food, it’s thus logical to assume that someone went to their home and consumed the same.</p><p>“Imagine having the audacity not only to f*** Shakira’s man but to eat Shakira’s jam,” one person tweeted.</p><p>Fans were then quick to form their own theories about the story, mostly thinking that Pique’s mistress was the one responsible for the eaten jam. Specifically, they are guessing that it might be the Spanish striker’s current girlfriend, 23-year-old Clara Chia Marti. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shakira</a>, on the other hand, neither confirmed nor denied the issue.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Her Latest Single “Bzrp Music Sessions #53” is Now Peaking in Music Charts</h2><p>Amid ongoing speculations, Shakira is presently carving her name in the music charts. Her first collaboration with Bizzarap, “Bzrp Music Sessions #53” soared to no. 16 on the multimetric Hot Latin Songs chart in less than two days.</p><p>Moreover, it reached top 10 on Latin Pop Airplay, having 1.8 million audience impressions from the U.S. In the same tracking week, it recorded 4.2 million on-demand U.S. streams.</p><p>This latest release also appears to pertain to Shakira and Pique’s history. Similar to her previous singles, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shakira seemingly disses her ex-man</a> while taking pride in self-love.</p><p>“You thought you hurt me, but you made me stronger/ Women don’t cry anymore, they cash in,” the lyrics reads.</p><p>Apparently, some people believe that “Bzrp Music Sessions #53” shows Shakira’s internalized misogyny. Nonetheless, the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer stated that she created it for “women who rise up against those who make us feel insignificant.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_ValChmerkovskiy_JennaJohnson_Eric-McCandlessABC-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Jenna Johnson, Val Chmerkovskiy Drops Hint to Baby’s Name, Fans Come Up With Hilarious Guesses" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>gerard pique</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>shakira</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qGYpKGilnq0wdKpnJyslZl6qLHRmqmdZaCevrax0magp56ZmbKttdOyZJudk5bCtLGMqJ1mmV2owbOt1pucq6qpYreiuYyjmKtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
