 Biography: Founding member of The Beatles, Lennon formed a songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney that became one of the most successful and famous in the history of music. Born in Liverpool, Lennon was in the group the Quarrymen which eventually developed into the Beatles in 1960.
As part of the best-selling group in music history, Lennon wrote or co-wrote many of the band's biggest hits. His rebellious nature gave his writings, interviews and work a notably acerbic and sardonic wit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His rebellious nature gave his writings, interviews and work a notably acerbic and sardonic wit. After the group broke up in 1970, Lennon embarked on a successful solo career with his wife <a href=#>Yoko Ono</a>. This included the hit 1971 single "Imagine".</p><p>His political activism, particularly in protesting against the Vietnam War, made him a controversial figure; the White House under <a href=#>Richard Nixon</a> engaged in lengthy attempts to deport him.</p><p>In 1975 he withdrew from the music business to raise his son, Sean, but returned in 1980 to release the album Double Fantasy, with Yoko Ono. Three weeks after its release he was shot and killed by Mark David Chapman outside his Manhattan apartment. His death triggered an outpouring of grief on an unprecedented scale throughout the world.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>October 9</a>, <a href=#>1940</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Liverpool, United Kingdom</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Silent Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Dragon</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Libra</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>December 8</a>, <a href=#>1980</a> (aged 40)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Murdered</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Articles and Photos</h2><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/bach-beatles-sml.jpg width=270 height=225 alt="Johann Sebastian Bach, The Pop Chart Wizard!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Johann Sebastian Bach, The Pop Chart Wizard!</h3><span class=linked_text>Celebrated for his choral and sacred music composed nearly 400 years ago, Johann Sebastian Bach has had surprising influence on modern pop charts.</span><br><span class=linked_date>July 28, 1750</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/ol-blue-eyes-sml.jpg width=270 height=225 alt="Voice Of The Century – 'And Not Even Close'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Voice Of The Century – 'And Not Even Close'</h3><span class=linked_text>Frank Sinatra cut his first disc on this day.
