I got a guitar for my 16th birthday.</li><li>I grew up half the time in a small town called Mart, Texas, and half the time in L.A., because I was acting. My high school was crazy about football.</li><li>I don't really listen to the radio too much. I know that one song, "Hotline Bling."</li><li>I get a little freaked out when I'm around too many redheads. I only have about one or two red-haired friends, and when a bunch of us get together, I feel like there's going to be a fight that breaks out or something.</li><li>'Friday Night Lights' was kind of like my college years because I did four seasons of that. It was my first series. It was the most time I had with one character, and kind of growing and evolving with the character over that long of a span of time, it just allows you to sort of learn in a completely different way that I had never experienced.</li><li>I love playing guitar. I grew up with my dad playing. But acting is definitely the forefront, I guess I'd say, in terms of career and something that I really enjoy and feel lucky to be able to do</li><li>I'm open to all religions. Respecting Scientology is just like respecting any other religious view.</li><li>My focus is to grow, have fun, and work with people who inspire me, like Philip Seymour Hoffman.</li><li>I'm going to try to keep believing that if you do good work, people will keep calling. Whenever that fails, I'll just start going nuts on Twitter</li><li>I deleted my Facebook account when I was 19 because it didn't bring out good qualities in me. I figured, 'Well my mom's got a Facebook. If people want to find me, they can go through her.'</li><li>I think it would be fun to walk around in Bill Murray's mind for a while.</li><li>Right after<i> 'Friday Night Lights' </i>ended, I was in sort of an existential crisis.</li><li>I don't think I'm a slacker, but I don't have aspirations to, like, conquer Hollywood. Or the world. Or anything.</li><li>Awards shows... I just feel like a fish out of water at those things.</li><li>I don't feel competitive toward other actors. I'm competitive with myself.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2ecd6c480e853a4b.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover top facts about the handsome Michael Ealy</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/39013cf4e5b960aa.jpg><ul><li>Every role I take on, I try and bring my best and to be as honest as possible.
