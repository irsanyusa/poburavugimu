Tailgating is classic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American culture</a> and an important part of being an American football fan. Let’s learn what a tailgate party is and how to enjoy one.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-is-tailgating?>What is tailgating?</h2><p>To answer this question we need to take a step back and first ask, “what is a tailgate?”</p><p>A tailgate is the small door in the back storage part of a pickup truck that opens and lays flat. With the tailgate open you can sit on it or place items on top. The truck’s tailgate is like a mobile picnic table.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is where you get a very American combination: football, trucks and beer. So, what is a tailgate party? It’s a party held in the parking lot before the football game. Yes, people literally stand behind their trucks eating and drinking.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Tips-for-a-good-tailgate-party>Tips for a good tailgate party</h2><p>A fun tailgate party needs some preparation. We have a few tips for you to follow in case you get invited to this unique event sometime!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Get familiar with American football</h3><p>American Football is the most popular sport in the United States. There are 32 National Football League teams across the US. Each team plays 17 games per season. Only 9 games are played at the team’s home stadium. That means when there’s a home game, it’s a big deal. People will have huge football parties outside the stadium. That’s tailgating.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Get there early</h3><p>Most American football games begin in the afternoon around 1 p.m. or 4 p.m. On game day, football fans who want to tailgate will arrive in the football stadium parking lots in the morning.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Park your truck</h3><p>Outside of large urban cities such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York, Chicago, and San Francisco</a>, the United States has a lot of suburban residential areas. People love big trucks, driving into the city for sports games, and lots of parking space. Outside of large football stadiums, the parking lots are huge to accommodate large American trucks. Some people even bring their recreational vehicle (RV) for a mobile toilet. Porta-potties are usually located in the parking lot for tailgaters (party goers) as well.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Bring food and beer</h3><p>There is a lot of food and beer at a tailgate party. With several hours before the game, comfortably parked at the stadium, people open their car trunk or tailgate and begin eating, drinking and playing games. There are impressive set-ups with tables, chairs, tents, grills, smokers and more. When the game begins, they go inside the stadium to watch.</p><p>It’s not only professional American football. Americans are also crazy about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">college football</a> as well. A college football tailgate is the same but possibly wilder. Bear in mind the legal drinking age is 21 in the United States.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-enjoy-a-tailgate-party>How to enjoy a tailgate party</h2><p>We’ve answered the question, “what is a tailgate party?” Now, let’s talk about what to eat and do at a tailgate party.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Eat tailgate food</h3><p>What is tailgating without American BBQ food? You’ll need food and lots of it. At a tailgate party, you’re outside. People bring prepared foods to eat on paper plates:</p><ul><li>Chips and dip</li><li>Cookies</li><li>Sandwiches</li><li>Macaroni and cheese</li><li>Potato salad</li></ul><p>Pro tailgaters cook food at the tailgate on a portable grill or stove:</p><ul><li>Hamburgers</li><li>Hot dogs</li><li>Chicken wings</li><li>Barbecue ribs</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Play tailgate games</h3><p>Tailgaters like pre-game entertainment. One of the classic tailgate games is to throw the “pigskin” around which means to throw and catch an American football with your friends. Other games you might see:</p><ul><li>Cornhole</li><li>Ladder toss</li></ul><p>A lot of tailgate games involve drinking beer or alcohol more quickly. These can be games like:</p><ul><li>Flip cup</li><li>Beer pong</li><li>King’s cup</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Dress up</h3><p>Most importantly, American football fans will get into the spirit by wearing their team’s jersey and colors. The tailgate party will be decorated accordingly. At a college football tailgate, it will be the University’s colors. Some even paint their faces or write sporty messages on their bare chests.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Tailgating-is-the-ultimate-pre-game-party>Tailgating is the ultimate pre-game party</h2><p>Americans love American football. To build excitement for their team’s home game, they have elaborate parties in the parking lot of the stadium. From the back of their cars and trucks, football fans eat, drink, and play games for hours. Tailgating is unique to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American culture</a> and a fun experience.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
