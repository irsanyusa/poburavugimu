  During a yawn, several things happen: your jaw stretches, your eardrums tighten, and sometimes, your eyes water."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This sequence of events engages various muscles and parts of your brain, making it a multifaceted reflex.</p><p>As it turns out, science doesn't have a single, definitive answer to the question of why we yawn. There are a few different theories, and it's likely that yawning serves multiple purposes.</p><p>So, here are some fascinating reasons why we take those big, dramatic breaths.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>1. Waking up the brain</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-489b3214-5c1e-4b5c-9dee-7d7b39bf7219 data-caption="Yawning wakes up the brain [iStock]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/jJEktkpTURBXy9hN2M2YjJjN2I1Nzg3ODI4MTkwODE5YTZlZmY1NTJlNC5qcGeRlQLNAmTNAVjCww></span><p>We yawn when we're feeling tired or sleepy. This might seem counterintuitive – shouldn't we be trying to conserve energy when we're tired? Well, one theory suggests that yawning actually helps us wake ourselves up. The big yawn draws in a lot of fresh air, which increases oxygen levels in the blood. This oxygen boost might help to invigorate the brain and improve alertness.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>2. Cooling down the brain</h3></p><p>Our brains work hard throughout the day, and just like a computer, they can sometimes overheat. One theory suggests that yawning helps to cool down the brain. The deep breath in brings in cooler air, while the opening of the mouth allows for some heat to escape.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>3. Stretching the jaw and ears</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Yawning involves a lot of movement, not just in your mouth but also in your ears and jaw. Some scientists believe that yawning is a reflex that helps to stretch and lubricate these areas, keeping them functioning properly.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>4. The empathy yawn</h3></p><p>Have you ever noticed that yawning can be contagious? You see someone yawn, and suddenly you find yourself yawning too.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-51db993c-5aa5-4438-94e7-4f60cad8890c data-caption="Yawning is contagious [MattressClarity]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/jXrktkpTURBXy8wMTEwYjUwMTRjNTIyZGI2YjllMjcxOWQ5NGFkZGNjYS5qcGeRlQLNAljNAcLCww></span><p>This phenomenon might be linked to empathy. Yawning in response to others could be a way of showing that you're picking up on their cues and understanding their feelings.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>Yawning is not just for sleepiness</h3></p><p>While yawning is associated with sleepiness, it's not always a sign you need a nap. Yawning can also happen when you're:</p><ul class=list><li>Bored: If your mind isn't stimulated, your body might yawn to try and wake itself up.</li><li>Stressed: Feeling overwhelmed can sometimes lead to yawning.</li><li>Hungry: Your body might be trying to tell you it needs some fuel.</li><li>Nervous: Yawning can be a way of managing anxiety.</li></ul><p>Yawning is just your body's way of taking care of itself. It keeps you healthy and functioning at your best. And hey, if you do need a nap after a big yawn, that's perfectly okay too.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This content was created with the help of an AI model and verified by the writer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSpxYydpmavlWLGosPNaKWlq2duxak%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
