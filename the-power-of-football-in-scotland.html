Although the results don’t always bring joy, the fans play their part in bringing that infamous Scottish spirit wherever they go.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Two fan-led organisations have used football’s sense of community to inspire support for disadvantaged children.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=#>Tartan Army Children’s Charity</a> started out as an appeal linked to Scotland’s match in Ukraine in 2006, and now helps children both ‘home and away’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The charity supports organisations for children in need around the world and inspires the next generation of players and fans by welcoming children into the football community through its ‘My First Scotland Match’ programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another Scotland football charity was inspired by a young boy in need of a prosthesis after being injured in the Bosnian War. Now, the <a href=#>Tartan Army Sunshine Appeal</a> supports a local children’s organisation in each country where the Scotland team play an away game – helping to bring some ‘sunshine’ where it’s needed. In 2024, the charity celebrated its 100th consecutive donation.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjpqZqK2kYsCku9OlmKecX5jCrcDUq5xoq6Ckv7V706GcZqifrLKzec6fZJ%2Bnn6mvorjLZqCnZaOYvLW4wKeb</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
