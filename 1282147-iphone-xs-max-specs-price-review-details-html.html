The chipset is an improvement of the A11 Bionic, and it can do up to 5 trillion operations every second.</p><p class=align-left>It has a powerful CPU which is hexa-core (2x2.5 GHz Vortex + 4x1.6 GHz Tempest). The processor speed is high and efficient and makes the phone ideal for multitasking and even gaming. For the graphics, it comes with an upgraded Apple GPU (4-core graphics).</p><h3>Storage</h3><p class=align-left>The three different versions of iPhone Xs Max all have 4 GB RAM but the ROM size varies between 64 GB, 256 GB and 512 GB.

It captures the essential requirements of users with its numerous features. It relies on a processor that is fast and suitable for gaming and multitasking. Its large display unit and high screen resolution make it a top priority for gamers and those who love watching videos. The lack of an external memory slot is a step-down if you need a higher storage capacity than that provided by the internal memory.</p><p class=align-left>While the iPhone Xs Max would give you an incredible user experience, the phone is costly, and its price might not be within the reach of a majority of people. If you are not limited to iPhones, you can opt for other brands such as the Huawei P20 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 9.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnOEkWprcGWZpbWwusRmr6xlnZbFbr%2FPnpqsZaCntqSxjKucr6GVrHqlsdOaoKWrXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
