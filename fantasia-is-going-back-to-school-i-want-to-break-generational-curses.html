As she attempts to finish a degree, she wishes to serve as an inspiration, most especially to her kids.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fantasia Returns to University to Study Business</h2><p>Years back, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantasia</a> dropped out of high school as a teenage kid. Yet, while she has backed up the fact a degree is not always required to reach certain milestones, the singer is going back to school with a bigger vision.</p><p>“I’m a businesswoman now and I desire to continue to sharpen my sword and better my craft,” she<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> said</a>. “I want to break generational curses. When it comes to my family, my girls, my children, I want to show them that no matter what she’s been through, you can always get back and go after it again, and that’s what I am doing.”</p><p>At present, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantasia</a> is a student at Central State University, hoping for a diploma in business. According to the honorary Sigma Gamma Rho sorority sister, she wants to set an example to “men, women, Black, white, young, old.” She went on and stated that dreams don’t have a deadline.</p><p>“It doesn’t have to look a certain way and, in fact, looks better when it has a bunch of bruises and scars because that means you fought for it,” she said.</p><p>Fantasia is mom to son Dallas Xavier, daughter Zion Quari, and newly welcomed daughter Kendall Taylor. With her schedule getting jam-packed, the musician maintains that her priority will always be family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-appeared-on-celebrity-prank-wars>She Appeared on Celebrity Prank Wars</h2><p>Fantasia’s latest appearance on screen was on E!’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Prank Wars</a> alongside her The Color Purple co-star Taraji P. Henson. For the “Lose to Win” singer, being part of the competition series is a pleasurable experience.</p><p>“It was all in love and fun. I grew up in a house with brothers and a big family, so this is the type of stuff that we were doing as kids and I really enjoy it,” she said.</p><p>The Color Purple is Fantasia’s first appearance in the big screen. Apparently, during filming, Henson was one of the people that would jokingly tell the musician “stupid things” such as looking at the wrong camera and going to the wrong mark. Hence, Fantasia is considering Celebrity Prank Wars as a way to get back at him.</p><p>“Every day, every day, they brought something to me and I just harbored it and I would look at Taraji and tell her, ‘I’m gonna get you back one day,” she said.</p><p>Celebrity Prank Wars airs Thursday night at 10 p.m. ET/PT on E!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_EdSheeran-220x147.jpg alt="Ed Sheeran Joins a New York Subway Singer Mid-Song For an Epic Duet" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xZqlrZmjnq5utdJmnqihnpx6o63CpGStp12osKm7zqVkomWnlru1edOoZJuqlZa4brPEp5yrmaSevK%2Bty2aarqqjmsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
