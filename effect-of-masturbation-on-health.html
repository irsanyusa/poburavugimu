Most people will never admit to taking matters into their own hands. This is because it is a topic people don’t want to talk about. Sex is hard enough to admit, how much more masturbation. In fact, it is considered something of a taboo in most places. All these notwithstanding, masturbation has health benefits to include:</p><p><strong>· It allows you to really understand your body</strong></p><p>For a lot of people, the first initiation into sexual pleasure was through masturbation. And they most likely didn’t stop ‘touching themselves’ when they eventually had sex. Masturbation gives people privacy and boldness to explore and discover what works for them sexually. Once they have discovered their pleasure points, they can discuss this with their sexual partners, which can lead to a richer, more exciting sex life.</p><p>“When you know what gets you off sexually, your lover will learn from you. Sex is awesome when you know what you want,” Says Jayne Eze, a sex therapist and relationship counsellor in Lagos.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>· Masturbation will relieve stress and get rid of that nagging headache</strong></p><p>Are you wondering how a short masturbation session can melt away your stress and make your aches and pains disappear? The answer is simple. The hustle and bustle of life can take a toll after a while, and masturbation allows you to reboot. It isn’t always about the orgasm. Self-intimacy allows you to reconnect with yourself in a way no one can fathom.</p><p>Additionally, the science behind the stress-relieving aspect of self-intimacy is tried and true. As with all sexual activity, masturbation leads to the release of endorphins—a natural pleasure chemical that soothes even the most frazzled nerves. Once your body releases endorphins, your mood will improve and you will sleep better.</p><p><strong>· Masturbation prevents diseases</strong></p><p>There’s no talking about the effect of mastrubation on health without mentioning its disease prevention abilities in men.
