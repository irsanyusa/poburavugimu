This episode featured Team Legend’s battle to the Top 12. Here’s everything you missed.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-john-legend-reveals-super-save>John Legend Reveals Super Save</h2><p>First up, was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Legend</a>‘s super save pick, Azán. Legend admitted that he brought Azán back because she was one of the best performers of the season. The singer returned to The Voice stage singing “Adorn” by Miguel. Coaches absolutely loved this performance, they commented on her ability to deliver such a flawless moment.</p><p>Up next was Legend’s only country artist, Kristen Brown. She returned to the stage singing Lady A’s hit “Need You Now.” The coaches were clearly enjoying this song, singing along in their chairs. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reba McEntire</a> admitted that Kristen deserved to get to the top of the leaderboard.</p><p>Kaylee Shimizu, Team Legend’s youngest member, took the stage next, singing “You Put a Move on My Heart” by Quincy Jones and Tamia. Legend himself said it in her package, this song is incredibly hard to sing, so this is almost like a test. Legend more or less admitted that if Kaylee’s rendition was successful, she’d go into the Top 12.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-team-legend-continues-to-impress-in-the-final-playoff>Team Legend Continues to Impress in The Final Playoff</h2><p>Up next was Legend’s Knockout round save, Taylor Deneen. In this round, she returned to the stage singing “Get Here” by Oleta Adams. This powerful rendition impressed all of the coaches, including Legend.</p><p>The second to last singer of the episode was Lila Forde. She brought the song “Angel from Montgomery” by Bonnie Raitt and John Prine to the stage in this round. Lila gave such a beautiful rendition of this song, it was hard to remember that this isn’t her song.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The final singer of the episode was Mac Royals. He came to the stage singing “Untitled” by D’Angelo. This song was a fantastic choice for Mac, since it showed off his strength in R&B music. Legend wasn’t kidding when he called Mac an upcoming R&B singer.</p><p>At the end of the episode, Legend picked his final three Team Legend artists. Remaining on Team Legend is Mac Royals, Lila Forde, and Azán.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-season-24-top-12-revealed>The Voice Season 24 Top 12, Revealed</h2><p>The Voice Season 24 Top 12 is officially ready for the live rounds.
