In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2020 interview on&nbsp;Ellen DeGeneres’ show, Justin explained why Hailey didn’t want to&nbsp;have kids right away. The singer said he’s fine with letting Hailey decide when and how many children they’ll have.</p><p>“It’s her body and whatever she wants to&nbsp;do,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “Hailey still has some things she wants to&nbsp;accomplish as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman.” He&nbsp;jokingly added, “I’m going to&nbsp;have as&nbsp;many as&nbsp;Hailey is&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;push out. I’d love to&nbsp;have myself a&nbsp;little tribe.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e2/095/b2a86a597c81f1d413657b48ff.jpg><p>Hailey has talked about the pressure on&nbsp;women after <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, saying life events don’t have to&nbsp;follow a&nbsp;strict timeline. The model said there are career goals she wants to&nbsp;accomplish before becoming a&nbsp;mother.</p><p>“There’s this thing that happens for women when you get married. Everybody always assumes it’s: First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the baby,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “Well, what about all the things&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;accomplish in&nbsp;my&nbsp;business?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/185/0d1/f68ea854c68f3d5562f0eeee10.jpg><p>Hailey was quite open about her decision to&nbsp;wait to&nbsp;have kids. She mentioned that she “definitely” doesn’t plan to&nbsp;have kids in&nbsp;2022, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I&nbsp;think&nbsp;I had it&nbsp;ingrained in&nbsp;my&nbsp;head that&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;have kids right away, and&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;have kids super, super young. Then I&nbsp;turned&nbsp;25, and I’m like, ’I’m still super, super young!’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f0/792/73996d5470b6fb302a1df6457b.jpg><p>The <i>Rhode </i>founder also candidly expressed her fears that their future child might become the target of&nbsp;online criticism. “It’s enough that people say things about my&nbsp;husband or&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends. I&nbsp;can’t imagine having to&nbsp;confront people saying things about a&nbsp;child,” she said. “We&nbsp;can only do&nbsp;the best we&nbsp;can to&nbsp;raise them. As&nbsp;long as&nbsp;they feel loved and safe,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c37/d3b/fa41435b5e8839d415760ad0ab.jpg><p>The reality proved that the future mother’s fears were far from the truth. When the couple announced their happy news, people rushed to&nbsp;congratulate them, leaving warm and heartfelt wishes. “Going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most beautiful baby! So&nbsp;happy for you both,” one follower <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commented</a>. “I’ve never been more excited about a&nbsp;celebrity baby in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. Congratulations Justin, you deserve this so&nbsp;much! You’re going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;amazing daddy,” another user wrote.</p><p>People often eagerly anticipate celebrity <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> news, but they also tend to&nbsp;make accusations that may not be&nbsp;true. <a href=# title="Jennifer Aniston" data-link=tag>Jennifer Aniston</a>, for instance, has once again found herself at&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;speculation about her pregnancy. Despite the rumors, she firmly believes that women don’t need a&nbsp;husband or&nbsp;child to&nbsp;feel fulfilled.
