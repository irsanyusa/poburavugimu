In Donald’s Happy Birthday, his birthday is said to be March 13.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>He was in the military</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On May 1, 1942, Donald Duck made his first appearance in the military in the film Donald Gets Drafted, according to <a href=#>Military.com</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cline told <a href=#>ABC7’s On The Red Carpet</a> that the U.S. government asked <a href=#>Disney</a> to use Donald Duck in short films that tried to motivate people to pay their taxes to support the war effort during World War II.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Mickey Mouse Is Now in the Public Domain After 95 Years of Disney Copyright</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Donald Duck has a middle name</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Donald Gets Drafted, viewers can see his draft card, which lists his middle name as Fauntleroy, according to Military.com.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Famous voice actor may </strong>have inspired character's creation</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Clarence Nash had a talent for animal imitations, film historian J.B. Kaufman told <a href=#>NPR</a>. The voice actor had already been doing some freelance work for Disney before he took on the iconic—and often unintelligible—role of Donald Duck, according to Kaufman. Kaufman said that Nash is partly to thank for the creation of Donald Duck—the voice actor had a “parlor trick of putting on this baby goat’s voice” to do “Mary Had A Little Lamb,” and when Walt Disney heard this, he imagined a talking duck.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nash also voiced Donald Duck’s nephews, Uncle Scrooge, and sometimes even Mickey Mouse, according to the <a href=#>Oklahoma Historical Society</a>. While Nash retired from Disney in 1971, he often performed his duck voice for children who were in hospitals. He voiced Donald Duck one last time for Mickey’s Christmas Carol in 1983, before he died of leukemia in 1985.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since 1985, Tony Anselmo has been the main voice behind Donald Duck. He was trained by Nash himself for the role, according to the <a href=#>Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> website.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Donald Duck has a twin sister</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While most fans know that Donald Duck has three nephews—Huey, Dewey, and Louie—some may not know that he has a twin sister. Della Duck, Donald Duck’s twin and a mom to Donald Duck's three nephews, appears in the TV show DuckTales, which debuted in 2017 as a reboot of the previous show, according to the <a href=#>Associated Press</a>. Part of Della Duck’s storyline in the show is about her crash landing on the moon, which caused her to lose a leg.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>He was in TV Guide’s 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Donald Duck ranked at 43 in the 2002 list, sharing the list with other beloved characters like Bugs Bunny, Homer Simpson, The Grinch, and SpongeBob SquarePants, <a href=#>CNN</a> reported.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Donald Duck has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The beloved Disney character was granted Hollywood stardom in a ceremony on Aug. 9, 2004.

In an informal deal, Disney allowed the university to use the beloved cartoon character’s likeness for its mascot for free, so long as “it was used in a reputable manner,” according to the <a href=#>university’s website</a>. When Walt Disney died in 1966, his estate and the university realized there wasn’t a formal contract over the mascot, so the two parties “worked to create a written agreement outlining the terms of Donald’s continued use as Oregon’s official duck representative,” the university said on its website.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Get alerts on the biggest breaking news stories <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></strong></p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWhsfXGAjp2mp5mcmXqlwcKkZJuhoqm1pa3YZpuiq56axm59j2aqrqqgp7a0tc2gZJ%2BZk6nAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
