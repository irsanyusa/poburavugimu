Expectedly, fans are all over the internet, making sense out of the song’s lyrics and music video.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-drops-new-single-flowers-on-liam-hemsworth-s-birthday>Miley Cyrus Drops New Single “Flowers” on Liam Hemsworth’s Birthday</h2><p>Ahead of its official release, fans were more than convinced that “Flowers” is about her former husband. Specifically, they speculate that the single may be Cyrus’s post-breakup project. Part of the lyrics which says “I can love me better, baby” may be a hint alone. Yet, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyrus</a> put out this song on Hemsworth’s 33rd birthday, further igniting her fans’ theories.</p><p>Apparently, Cyrus seems to reference the Woolsey fire where their Malibu house burned down. The “Wrecking Ball” singer may have also intimated a message to Hemsworth, expressing that tried to work their marriage out.</p><p>“We were right ’til we weren’t / Built a home and watched it burn / Mmm, I didn’t wanna leave you / &nbsp;I didn’t wanna lie,” the song’s lyrics read.</p><p>Before Hemsworth suddenly filed for divorce, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyrus</a> reportedly fought for their relationship. While she wants her marriage to stand the test of time, she didn’t want to change herself. Consequently, she had no choice but to give up. Such complicated and devastating experience is why “Flowers” feels liberating.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Deem This Song as an Empowering Self-Love Anthem</h2><p>In the music video, Cyrus strips down to a black lingerie as she goes for a swim alone in the pool. She completes a workout, then proceeds to enjoy a good shower. During the end, the singer can be seen standing on a rooftop with a spotlight on her as she stares in the camera.</p><p>While “Flowers” could tell so much about Hemsworth, the single powerfully pertains to loving oneself. Indeed, Cyrus has successfully created an anthem about courage. As she enters in her brand-new era, the pop singer proves that she needs no man to live.</p><p>Cyrus will be releasing the entire <a href=#>Endless Summer Vacation</a> on March 10. Until this album gets to be public, fans can stream “Flowers” and make it their newest self-love anthem.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/HayleyErbert_DerekHough_FirstDance-220x147.jpg alt="Hayley Erbert’s Wedding Dance Post Causes Confusion Among Fans" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x56pnqtdrLW6edaeZK2gmaO4brnIpZyyZZOuv7a%2F0madpaenmr%2B0ecisZJqan6rBbrTEq2SesF2dwrSuwKebZqSZlrputMSmqrCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
