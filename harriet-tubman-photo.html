Catalogers believe that the photograph was taken between 1867 and 1869, when she lived in Auburn, N.Y., where Tubman — who had herself escaped from bondage in 1849 — took care of fugitive slaves in their old age."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Bunch III, the founding director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, said in a statement. “This new photograph shows her relaxed and very stylish.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fact that she’s seated in a parlor chair sporting a lace collar and elegant bodice reflects a deliberate way she carried herself at the time. As <a href=#>TIME has previously reported</a>, she often donned lace and fine clothes, believing that if she dressed respectably, then people would treat African Americans with respect. She particularly prized a lace shawl that Queen Victoria had given her in 1897.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This new portrait of Tubman was part of an album of 48 rare photographs previously owned by Emily Howland, a Quaker schoolteacher and abolitionist who lived 20 minutes south from Tubman in Sherwood, N.Y. Howland died in 1929.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture acquired the photos, which appear to date back to the 1860s, at auction in 2017. Highlights include pictures of Charles Dickens, Former Massachusetts U.S. Senator and abolitionist Charles Sumner, the writer and abolitionist <a href=#>Lydia Maria Child</a>, and the only known photograph of John Willis Menard, the first African-American man elected to Congress. The album also contained a copy of a more famous image of Tubman.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Catalogers have identified all but three of the individuals photographed.
