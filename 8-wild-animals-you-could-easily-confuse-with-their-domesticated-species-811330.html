It&nbsp;was identified as&nbsp;an&nbsp;African serval by&nbsp;the Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge, and <strong>it&nbsp;likely escaped from a&nbsp;captive situation</strong> and was left to&nbsp;fend for itself. However, the rescuers believe that its survival would not have lasted much longer, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was not adapted to&nbsp;the cold winter climate of&nbsp;the Midwest.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the refuge, the serval weighs 29&nbsp;pounds, making it&nbsp;roughly three times heavier than the average domestic cat. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;estimated to&nbsp;be&nbsp;around five years old, which is&nbsp;roughly one-fourth of&nbsp;its typical lifespan.</p><p><h2>2. Regular vs&nbsp;wild dogs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a63/de3/10bf865dde859559a4adef2193.jpg><p>It’s widely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believed</a> among researchers that the gray wolf is&nbsp;the progenitor of&nbsp;the domesticated dog. The time frame of&nbsp;this transformation is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;have <strong>taken place anywhere from 32,000 to&nbsp;14,000 years ago</strong>. However, there’s a&nbsp;minority of&nbsp;scientists who argue that dogs may have descended from an&nbsp;extinct wild ancestor, potentially similar to&nbsp;modern-day pariah dogs or&nbsp;dingoes. Regardless of&nbsp;its origins, the dog remains the first animal to&nbsp;have ever been domesticated by&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Centuries of&nbsp;affection toward dogs has led to&nbsp;the creation of&nbsp;over 400 breeds of&nbsp;domestic dogs. Studies on&nbsp;the origin of&nbsp;dogs and their special bond with humans are still ongoing.</p><p><h2>3. Regular vs&nbsp;wild goats</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f1/188/451a2f5ef08a2dadc0e70a7a6b.jpg><p>Humans selectively bred the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bezoar</a>, also known as&nbsp;the wild goat, as&nbsp;the second species of&nbsp;wild animal. At&nbsp;first glance, these agile, wiry ungulates may not seem like ideal candidates for domestication, but their capacity to&nbsp;convert scarce plants into valuable resources such as&nbsp;hides, <a href=# title=meat data-link=tag>meat</a>, and milk made the effort worthwhile for settlers in&nbsp;the Fertile Crescent. The <strong>breeding of&nbsp;these animals began as&nbsp;early as&nbsp;11,000 years ago </strong>and resulted in&nbsp;generations of&nbsp;solitary goat herders.</p><p>The domestic goat now boasts over 200 distinct breeds. Ranging from tiny miniatures kept as&nbsp;household pets, to&nbsp;cashmere goats with soft coats used for textiles, to&nbsp;large animals weighing close to&nbsp;300&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>4. Regular vs&nbsp;wild sheep</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4d/dd3/9aaba857bd8ac29c9e132004f0.jpg><p>Around&nbsp;10,000 years ago, several <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>subspecies</a> of&nbsp;this wild sheep (mouflon) were brought down from the mountains. Their offspring eventually became the ancestors of&nbsp;early Ugg boots and shearling jackets. It&nbsp;wasn’t until several thousand years later that wool-producing varieties emerged. Early&nbsp;on, they were killed for their hides and meat instead of&nbsp;being bred for wool production.</p><p><strong>The domestic sheep encompasses over 200&nbsp;breeds</strong>, from breeds that produce excessive amounts of&nbsp;wool and require regular shearing to&nbsp;avoid overheating, to&nbsp;tropical varieties with smooth coats similar to&nbsp;goats. Despite the sheep’s reputation for being docile and easily managed, some breeds have displayed remarkable levels of&nbsp;intelligence, including the ability to&nbsp;recognize their own names.</p><p><h2>5. Regular vs&nbsp;wild pigs</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3aa/ccf/3255f859309f5e230f349bebe9.jpg><p>Approximately&nbsp;9,000 years ago, someone daringly captured a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wild boars</a>, likely in&nbsp;present-day <a href=# title=Turkey data-link=tag>Turkey</a>. Chinese and European wild boars were probably domesticated independently. Regardless of&nbsp;their origins, <strong>their descendants were relegated to&nbsp;living off of&nbsp;human waste</strong>. In&nbsp;ancient towns, pigs were commonly seen roaming the streets, eating garbage, and providing a&nbsp;readily available source of&nbsp;meat.</p><p>The once-fierce wild boar has been domesticated into about 70&nbsp;breeds of&nbsp;domestic pig, ranging from pink pigs to&nbsp;large, hairy breeds adapted to&nbsp;specific environments. Despite being widely discredited, pigs are highly intelligent animals. Recent medical advancements suggest that they may even be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;grow new hearts for transplantation.</p><p><h2>6. Regular vs&nbsp;wild cows</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10e/eed/422fc3594ca5ed11ef8d4cf6c5.jpg><p>The ancestry of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cattle</a> can be&nbsp;traced back to&nbsp;the extinct aurochs. Similar to&nbsp;several other species, cattle were most likely domesticated on&nbsp;multiple occasions. The first instance of&nbsp;<strong>domestication took place about 10,500 years ago in&nbsp;Iran</strong>. The zebu is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;have originated from the Indian subspecies of&nbsp;the aurochs, approximately 6000 years later.</p><p>African cattle have evolved from the earlier line and were later interbred with the indicus type, known for its distinctive hump, which provides better adaptation to&nbsp;warm climates. There are over 800 recognized breeds of&nbsp;cattle, although only a&nbsp;small portion of&nbsp;these are acknowledged by&nbsp;breed organizations. The world cattle population is&nbsp;estimated at&nbsp;1.5&nbsp;billion.</p><p><h2>7. Regular vs&nbsp;wild goldfish</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7b/370/142fd657c1854733a6134864f5.jpg><p>Earlier beliefs held that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>goldfish</a> were descendants of&nbsp;the Crucian carp, but recent studies have revealed that they either come from the closely related Prussian carp or&nbsp;are a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;hybridization. Unlike their domesticated counterparts, wild goldfish possess a&nbsp;muted color palette of&nbsp;metallic greens instead of&nbsp;vibrant oranges and whites. The selective <strong>breeding of&nbsp;mutant forms of&nbsp;goldfish began in&nbsp;China about 2000 years ago</strong>. During the Tang Dynasty, goldfish ponds became a&nbsp;popular landscaping feature in&nbsp;China.</p><p>Despite the unfortunate tradition of&nbsp;handing out goldfish as&nbsp;carnival prizes, leading to&nbsp;the death of&nbsp;many of&nbsp;these pets, goldfish are also a&nbsp;popular food source for captive carnivorous fish. If&nbsp;properly cared for, goldfish can live for over a&nbsp;decade, yet many still succumb to&nbsp;premature deaths.</p><p><h2>8. Regular vs&nbsp;wild horses</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/200/3b5/f6f62b5135939889ab1695a7c8.jpg><p>Approximately&nbsp;6,000 years ago, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wild horse</a> were domesticated in&nbsp;the regions now known as&nbsp;Kazakhstan. During its early domestication, the horse was utilized for transportation and was also a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;food. The present-day horse has evolved greatly, and its wild ancestor is&nbsp;now extinct.</p><p>Today’s horse <strong>boasts more than 200 recognized breeds</strong> and hundreds of&nbsp;additional local breeds not recognized by&nbsp;breeding organizations. In&nbsp;2013, there was a&nbsp;controversy when a&nbsp;European food processing company mislabeled horse meat as&nbsp;beef, which led to&nbsp;several recalls of&nbsp;products containing the meat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIVuw8ilm2aZnp66orjSZrCorV2YvLa4w2acmquZocZur86nna6rlWLEqsDHZquhnZmneqW7zJ6qraGTlsGmsIysp56bmZrAboSQampsaF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
