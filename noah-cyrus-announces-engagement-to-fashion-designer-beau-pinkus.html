The 23-year-old singer-songwriter and the couturier have apparently leveled up their relationship for quite some time and have just enjoyed the dreamy moment in private before going public about it.</p><p>“The greatest moment of my entire life was saying ‘yes’ to spending the rest of ours together,” she wrote. “This past month of being your fiancé and being in our own little world of just us two has been so perfect and i wish i could never leave this time.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyrus</a>, she didn’t think she would ever meet a man so selfless like Pinkus. The “All Falls Down” singer described her beau as “the least judgemental human being i’ve ever met. the most talented, the most loyal, the kindest person.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ve never felt more loved or in love. i now know the feeling of forever not being long enough. i’m so excited to spend this life with you , our life so far is a life i never thought i deserved or would live,” she wrote.</p><p>Cyrus ended her post stating that she’s “lucky” and “grateful” for Pinkus. In a naughty comment, the fashion enthusiast responded to her saying: “u want kids?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-showed-off-her-engagement-ring-last-week>She Showed Off Her Engagement Ring Last Week</h2><p>Several fans have apparently anticipated Cyrus’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">engagement</a> days before her official announcement. In her June 23 post, Cyrus uploaded a photo of her wearing a shimmering diamond ring. Although the singer didn’t write any caption, she tagged Pinkus right where the ring is in the photo.</p><p>“Did you get engaged?? I see that ring, girl,” one fan wrote.</p><p>Last Sunday, Pinkus uploaded a photo of Cyrus walking in the Marine Serre fashion show in Paris. As the singer was wearing her engagement ring, Pinkus captioned his post “proudest fiancé.”</p><p>In early 2023, fans had already speculated that Cyrus and Pinkus are in a relationship. Subsequently, they became Instagram official in February, with Cyrus wearing his designs.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_Murmuration_Casey-DurkinNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="12 Best ‘America’s Got Talent’ 2023 Auditions You Can’t Miss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Noah Cyrus</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaiYoWWTrr%2B2v4yapaenpaOwpr%2BMnqWgmZeauqa602arqGWWlsCptc6nZJ2do560r7HRZpmemaVivaq6yq6qaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
