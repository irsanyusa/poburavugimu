This was the very question Treasury Minister David Gauke raised when he recently attempted to expand the debate around tax avoidance, by looking at cash-in-hand as another side of the 'aggressive' tax avoidance coin.
Mr Gauke, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, was expressing growing concern in Whitehall about the cash-in-hand economy, which the Treasury estimates costs the UK anywhere from £2 billion to £8 a year in lost tax revenues."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Whilst it is the responsibility of the trader to pay tax, paying cash with the intention that tax may be avoided is complicit in law-breaking.
