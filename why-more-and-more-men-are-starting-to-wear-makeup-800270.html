Upper-class men of&nbsp;ancient Egypt often <strong>lined their eyes</strong>. You’ve probably seen the images of&nbsp;Egyptian kings with their eyes thickly lined with black kohl.</p><p>Men from ancient Rome were also encouraged to&nbsp;use makeup under the influence of&nbsp;those who conquered them, including the Egyptians. Roman men didn’t wear bright makeup, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was frowned upon by&nbsp;society. Instead, they would <a href=#>wear</a> light perfume, <strong>remove certain body hair,</strong> and sometimes whiten their faces.</p><p>During the times of&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I, men were into <a href=#>powdering</a> their faces, and in&nbsp;Japan in&nbsp;the 17th century, male actors from the <a href=#>Kabuki</a> theater would <a href=#>wear</a> eye-catching makeup with bright red and black lines on&nbsp;a&nbsp;thick white background created with the help of&nbsp;rice flour. Getting closer to&nbsp;modern times, we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;mention the era of&nbsp;old Hollywood that <strong><a href=#>brought</a> male makeup onto the big screen</strong> and into the public eye.</p><p><h2>Hollywood actor Clark Gable</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/18e/582/05c85a57dda8c74f6a5b086724.jpg><p>Even though wearing makeup is&nbsp;not new for men, until recently, it&nbsp;was mainly actors and musicians who were wearing makeup to&nbsp;make their looks on&nbsp;screen and on&nbsp;stage more eye-catching and bright. Today, we&nbsp;see more and more men using beauty products in&nbsp;their daily lives as&nbsp;well, <strong>so&nbsp;why is&nbsp;male makeup on&nbsp;the rise now</strong>?</p><p><h2>More male beauty products are appearing on&nbsp;the market.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06b/c1a/cab33f53b1a216af3f7ef9076a.jpg><p>Yes, men have been using makeup since ancient times, but until recently there were very few cosmetic products designed especially for men. Things are changing now as&nbsp;more companies are <strong>manufacturing male cosmetics</strong> and are <a href=#>selling</a> these beauty products at&nbsp;men’s beauty counters in&nbsp;their stores. Of&nbsp;course, men can use traditional cosmetics designed for women, but some might still feel uncomfortable with that. So, the wider the choice of&nbsp;male beauty products, the more men are encouraged to&nbsp;try them on&nbsp;their faces.</p><p>It&nbsp;looks like the male audience is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge growth <a href=#>opportunity</a> for the beauty industry, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;believed that we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;see more male-targeted and gender-neutral cosmetics in&nbsp;the near future. Big brands are introducing <strong>collections that are specially created for men</strong>. The Boy De&nbsp;Chanel <a href=#>collection</a> by&nbsp;Chanel, for example, offers a&nbsp;wide variety of&nbsp;beauty and skincare goods for men, including moisturizer, foundation, concealer, eye pencils, lip balm, and nail polish for creating a&nbsp;natural look.</p><p><h2>There are more male makeup influencers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4bb/f30/e5fe275d629c5fff6585fffeb6.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Makeup artist Manny Gutierrez (Manny MUA)</p><p>Male designed beauty products alone would probably not be&nbsp;enough this big rise in&nbsp;male makeup usage. There need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;people who <strong>inspire others to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;stereotypes</strong> and to&nbsp;try something new. <a href=#>Manny Gutierrez</a>, <a href=#>Jake-Jamie</a>, <a href=#>Gabriel Zamora</a>, and <a href=#>James Charles</a>&nbsp;— are just a&nbsp;few popular makeup artists who are sharing their beauty tips with thousands of&nbsp;men and women.</p><p>In&nbsp;their posts and video tutorials, these artists share makeup techniques that can help men and women create a&nbsp;large variety of&nbsp;looks, from light and natural to&nbsp;bright and festive. But what is&nbsp;more important is&nbsp;that they teach their audience to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more confident with their look, to&nbsp;love themselves the way they are, and <strong>to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;afraid</strong> of&nbsp;stigmas, stereotypes, and judgment on&nbsp;their way to&nbsp;expressing themselves through makeup.</p><p><h2>Here is&nbsp;a&nbsp;little collection of&nbsp;looks created by&nbsp;these and other makeup artists that can inspire you when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;your own beauty experiments.</h2></p><p><h2>1.
