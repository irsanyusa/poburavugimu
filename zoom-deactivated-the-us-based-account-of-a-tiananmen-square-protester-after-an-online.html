Although it did not explicitly say which local law this was, its statement suggested that users joining in from China may have meant the Zoom meeting fell under China's jurisdiction.</p><p>"Just like any global company, we must comply with applicable laws in the jurisdictions where we operate. When a meeting is held across different countries, the participants within those countries are required to comply with their respective local laws. We aim to limit the actions we take to those necessary to comply with local law and continuously review and improve our process on these matters," a Zoom spokesperson said.</p><p>Zoom has now reactivated the account.</p><p>Zhou told Axios Zoom didn't respond to his emails asking why his account was shut down.</p><p>"We are outraged by this act from Zoom, a US company," said Zhou. "As the most commercially popular meeting software worldwide, Zoom is essential as an unbanned outreach to Chinese audiences remembering and commemorating Tiananmen Massacre during the coronavirus pandemic."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7056aoWeqpLyuecOemJysmauutbHDZquhnV2qwG6uwKycnWWRmLCwwc2tZKieXZZ6tbXAp5inpZWjerS91JqpnmWgp7y1sdKtnKtlkZvBpr6MmqVmp56htq%2BxjrOvpbKdq4E%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
