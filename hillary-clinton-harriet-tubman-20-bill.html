Keep going. If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you hear gunshots, keep going. Keep going to freedom.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“And that to me represented so much about her, but also about our country,” Clinton continued. “We have work to do.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Clinton <a href=# rel=noopener>delivered similar remarks at the 2008 Democratic convention</a> when she urged the party to unify around then Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic Party’s nominee. Then, she said the country should follow “the example of a brave New Yorker, a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the Underground Railroad.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“And on that path to freedom, Harriet Tubman had one piece of advice,” Clinton said in 2008 in Denver. “If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If they’re shouting after you, keep going. Don’t ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tubman is a useful symbol for Clinton: a pioneering black woman who is widely admired for her courage, the former slave led more than 70 slaves to freedom and was a spy for the Union during the Civil War. Middle-aged and older women, as well as African Americans, are key pillars of Clinton’s support.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Clinton has remarked on Tubman and the $20 bill earlier in this campaign cycle, calling the possibility “awesome” in May last year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She said last week, too, that having Tubman on the $20 bill is not enough.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Clinton said on Friday she was “very excited about Harriet Tubman and the other women who are going to be included on our money.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But “I also want to make sure that women are making the money that we deserve to make,” Clinton said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZta2BqhnN8jqGgpaSRp8Zur8uipa2nnmK1or7RopytZaSqr66tzWZpaWWSnrmtew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
