The Super Bass rapper showed off her ample cleavage as she stepped out on Christmas Day evening in a very revealing catsuit.</strong></p><p>Nicki, 30, was the guest of honour as she was attending her own festive party which was held at Webster Hall in New York City. The star made sure that she was centre of attention by wearing the extremely low-cut black ensemble with some feisty shoulder pads at the event. Nicki had her chest on show as she arrived at the Christmas Extravaganza, and was quite happy to show off her low cut outfit.</p><p>The rapper was fairly close to having a wardrobe malfunction as her small and tight outfit was in serious danger of failing to hold her chest together. Luckily, the Trinidad and Tobago born artist escaped the embarrassment of a nipple slip and made her way into the party escorted by her entourage. Nicki, who was sporting a sleek bob, teamed the catsuit with a thick black belt and a large pair of red and black sunglasses. The Christmas Extravaganza is not the only party Minaj has put her name to as earlier this month, it was revealed that she would be hosting a New Year's Eve celebration at PURE nightclub, in Las Vegas. According to PURE's website: "The rapper, songwriter and television personality will throw a boisterous party as she leads the countdown to midnight and celebrates with partygoers at Las Vegas' top mega-club."</p><p>It is unclear whether Nicki, who celebrated her second multi-platinum album this year when Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded topped both US and UK album charts, will perform during her stint. The New Year's Eve celebration marks the culmination of a big year for the rapper, who also starred in a three-part fly-on-the-wall documentary series, and was appointed a judge on hit show American Idol for which she is expected to earn between $8 to $12 million. And the $5million fee Nicki is set to receive for the New Year's Eve gig is reportedly $1million more than world-famous superstar Beyoncé is making when she takes home $4million for an invitation-only concert at the rival Wynn Hotel, also in Vegas.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnl9lnJloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
