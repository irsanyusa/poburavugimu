NBC Reading Time: 2 minutes Bring the Funny returns with more open mics and more funny. They kicked off the show with a hilarious puppet and it only got better from there. I thought this week was funnier than last week. Let’s go through the acts and see who…brought the funny…see what I did there?

They kicked off the show with a hilarious puppet and it only got better from there. I thought this week was funnier than last week. Let’s go through the acts and see who…brought the funny…see what I did there?</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Randy Feltface</h4><p>A manic Australian puppet who is a pretty decent comic? This appeals to me interests. As an adult that watches more than my share of puppet shows, this was really slick. I particularly liked that they tried to create a sob story with his mother. The judges really liked them…even Chrissy who thinks puppets are creepy</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Michael Longfellow</h4><p>You can tell this guy is a pro. The jokes were well-crafted and the timing was really cool. It wasn’t a regular set up/punchline rhythm. It was more awkward, but a controlled awkwardness. The judges really dug him too. Like, he might win.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Room 28</h4><p>A solid premise for a sketch is one of the most important aspects to it working. Then you have to keep escalating the sketch. It reminds me of a sketch my group used to do about faded 90’s singers. I liked these guys better than the sketch group from last week.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Mandy Muden</h4><p>She combines two things you wouldn’t think would work: a saucy British gal and magic. For a second I thought she was doing to lob a knife at Jeff. If she could do that she belongs on AGT. Like, seriously. A million dollars, Mandy.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Regan and Watkins</h4><p>Musical comedy can be tough but these guys were pretty good. Not the best, but not the worst. It does need to be tightened up though. It was a little sloppy. Though the 21st century girl song was funny.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Morgan Jay</h4><p>This was musical comedy done like I’ve never seen it done before. Instead of just singing a funny song, he SANG the act. It was done in a singsongy style that is seriously original and cool. I really liked this act.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Jesus Trejo</h4><p>This guy was also really solid. He had a hilarious bit about his grandmother having 21 kids. I mean, if that’s in your family then you’d be a fool not to use it. He does need to slow down a bit, like Jeff said. But he’s super seasoned.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>These are the acts that got through…</h4><p>Morgan Jay, Michael Longfellow, Willy Appelman, Jesus Trejo, Ismo, and Randy Feltface. I was surprised Room 28 didn’t get through. Maybe they just hate Pitbull. Culo.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/agt-recap-judge-cuts-chris-klafford.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Recap: Judge Cuts Sends Some CRAZY Acts Onto The Live Shows" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waugp59dqbWmecWupaexXZe%2FsMHGoatmqKWlvabA0makrquZmHqiusNmp6Kskqq5rXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
