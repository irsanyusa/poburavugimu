She held a wine glass in one hand and lifted one of her legs up and rested it against the wall. If you look closely, a thin white string can be seen coming out of her rear. This then sent fans spiraling trying to figure out if the photo was real or fake.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: </strong><a href=# class=broken_link>Only Real ‘AGT’ Super Fans Can Remember When Heidi Klum Wore These Outfits</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>On Reddit</a>, someone reposted the photo that has since been taken down from Libby’s Instagram. “There are so many things wrong with this picture!
