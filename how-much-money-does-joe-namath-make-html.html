He played college football for the University of Alabama under coach Paul "Bear" Bryant from 1962 to 1964, and professional football in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) during the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>Statistics belie Namath's enduring influence on the game of professional football. He retired after playing 143 games over 13 years in the AFL and NFL, including playoffs. Due mainly to chronic injuries that undermined his career at its peak, his overall record is 68 wins, 71 losses, and four ties, 64-64-4 in 132 starts, and 4-7 in relief.</p><p>In 1999, he was ranked number 96 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, the only player on the list to have spent a majority of his career with the Jets. In his 1975 autobiography, Alabama head coach Bryant called Namath the most natural athlete he had ever coached.[citation needed]</p><p>Namath is known for boldly guaranteeing a Jets' victory over Don Shula's NFL Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III (1969), then making good on his prediction with a 16-7 upset (the win remains the Jets' only NFL championship). Already a celebrity, he was now established as a sports icon.</p>Net Worth:<h3>Joe Namath Net Worth: $<span id=Total>100 Million</span></h3><b>Joe Namath's Income / Salary:</b><br><b>Per Year:</b> $<span id=Year>20 Million</span><p><b>Per Month:</b> $<span id=Month>2 Million</span></p><p><b>Per Week:</b> $<span id=Week>500,000</span></p><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><td><b>Per Day:</b></td><td><b>Per Hour:</b></td><td><b>Per Minute:</b></td><td><b>Per Second:</b></td></tr><tr><td>$<span id=Day>70,000</span><span></span></td><td>$<span id=Hour>3,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Minute>50</span></td><td>$<span id=Second>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Since you arrived on this page at <span id=CurrentTime></span>, Joe Namath Earned: <span id=earnNow></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmwp6KptW%2B6xK1ma2hhbXxxhI6hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZvKa%2FjKOmnmWelrqiwMdmpJqjlWO1tbnL</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
