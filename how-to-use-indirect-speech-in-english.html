We use it to report on what someone has said, much like direct speech, but not as a direct quote.&nbsp;</p><p>To show you what we mean, let’s take one of the examples from above and turn it into an indirect statement:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Direct: </strong>US president: ‘I will end this pandemic’.</li><li><strong>Indirect: </strong>The US president said he would end this pandemic.</li></ul><p>While the message is the same, you can see that the indirect speech is no longer directly quoting the US president’s words.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s another one:</p><ul><li><strong>Direct: </strong>The man:<strong> </strong>‘If you give me all your money, no one will get hurt!’</li><li><strong>Indirect:</strong> The man said that if we gave him all our money, no one would get hurt.</li></ul><p>Now, let’s discuss how to change direct speech into indirect speech!</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to use affect and effect in English</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reporting statements using ‘say’ or ‘tell’</h2><p>First, we’ll look at the most common forms of indirect speech, which most commonly use the reporting verbs <strong>say </strong>and <strong>tell</strong>. A reporting verb is the verb you use to introduce what someone said.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Without a direct object (say)</h3><p>subject + reporting verb + (that) + clause&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Direct: </strong>Brother: I’ve quit my job.</p><p><strong>Indirect:</strong> My brother <strong>said </strong>(that) he had quit his job.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>With a direct object (tell)</h3><p>subject + reporting verb + direct object** + (that) + clause&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Direct: </strong>Carmel: I am leaving.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Indirect:</strong> Carmel <strong>told me </strong>(that) she was leaving.&nbsp;</p><p>**While the verb ‘say’ can stand alone, the verb ‘tell’ must use a direct object (in the example above that’s ‘me’).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Adding ‘that’</h3><p>You’ll see in the forms above, the word ‘<strong>that</strong>’ is in parenthese. That’s because you can decide to use it or not – it doesn’t usually make much difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The main reason you’d add the word ‘that’ is to give a bit of extra clarity to a sentence whose meaning could otherwise be a bit confusing.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Use and used to in English</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Reporting actions (orders, requests, promises, offers, etc.)</h2><p>When we report on something someone tells or asks you to do, or something that they’ve promised or offered, the form is different. A variety of reporting verbs can be used, such as <strong>promise</strong>, <strong>offer</strong>, <strong>ask</strong>, and <strong>order</strong>. Sometimes you should use a direct object, whereas other times, you shouldn’t.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Without a direct object</h3><p>subject + reporting verb + infinitive</p><p><strong>Direct: </strong>Brother: ‘I will pay you back in one month’.</p><p><strong>Indirect:</strong> My brother <strong>promised </strong>to pay<strong> </strong>me back in one month.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Direct:</strong> Sister: I can help you with your homework, if you’d like.</p><p><strong>Indirect: </strong>My sister <strong>offered </strong>to help me with my homework.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>With a direct object</h3><p>subject + reporting verb + direct object + infinitive</p><p><strong>Direct: </strong>Uncle: ‘Can you please watch the movie with us?’</p><p><strong>Indirect: </strong>My uncle <strong>asked me</strong> to watch the movie with them.</p><p><strong>Direct:</strong> Grandmother: Wash the dishes before the party!</p><p><strong>Indirect: </strong>My grandmother <strong>ordered me</strong> to wash the dishes before the party.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">How to confidently use reported speech in English</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Verb tense changes in English</h2><p>When you change a sentence from direct to indirect, the verb tenses change.
