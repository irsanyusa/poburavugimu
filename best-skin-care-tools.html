After all, your skin is exposed to all of the elements, from changes in weather and exposure to environmental pollutants to makeup and UV damage caused by the sun. Put simply: It’s hard to protect your skin from all of the outside interference that can lead to a myriad of skincare concerns, such as breakouts, hyperpigmentation, premature lines and wrinkles, dull skin tone, oiliness, dryness and more.</p><p>While regularly scheduled spa facial treatments are a wonderful way to ensure that your skin is well cared for, they can also cost you several hundred dollars each session. Luckily, more and more skin care tools that promise to help address your top skin concerns are now on the market. From LED light and cryotherapy to deep pore cleaners and microcurrent wands, we’re sharing some of the best skin care tools to hit the beauty market as well as what you need to know to use each to the best of its ability.</p><p>Before we dig into the best skin care tools in the beauty market, here’s what you should bear in mind as you consider which tools are best for you.</p><h3>Factor in your skin type and concerns</h3><p>Everyone’s skin falls into a certain type, namely one of the following: normal, dry, oily, combination, and sensitive. It’s important to choose a skin care tool that caters to your specific skin type so that you don’t exacerbate certain skin issues you might be having.</p><p>You also want to consider your specific skin concerns, such as hyperpigmentation (brown spots and discoloration), premature aging (early lines and wrinkles), dullness (lack of vibrancy), or breakouts (acne) in order to steer toward a tool targeted to your needs.</p><h3>Read reviews</h3><p>Be sure to comb through customer experiences, and try to find before and after photos so you can confirm a given skin care tool has been proven, by other consumers, to do all of the wonderful things it claims to do.</p><h3>Stay within your budget</h3><p>Skin care tools can range from affordable to expensive. In fact, some can cost as low as $10 while others can cost as high as $500. Make sure you’re staying within whatever price range feels reasonable to you and factor in all of the details to help you make your decision including how long you’ll plan on using it and whether or not it comes with a customer warranty.</p><h3>Best for multitasking: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>NuFace Trinity Microcurrent Facial Toning Device</a></h3><a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/ef3c5038008fa6c8d4395d30d49ffec8/a331c/nu-face-trinity.png></span></a><p>Pricey?

Exfoliation is an integral step in your skin care routine, as it helps keep your skin smooth, fresh and ideally acne-free. When you exfoliate, you’re sloughing off dead skin cells on top and revealing healthier and younger-looking skin underneath. While microdermabrasion treatments at a spa can cost several hundred dollars per session, this tiny device can offer results for a much smaller investment. It utilizes spinning-disc technology to achieve the same results and comes in nine colors.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Type: Electric</li><li>Size: 6.88 inches x 2.63 inches x 7.81 inches</li><li>Weight: 13.4 ounces</li><li>Special features: Comes in 9 different colors and four discs that vary in sensitivity</li><li>Warranty: Two-year limited warranty</li><li>Best for: Improving skin tone and texture</li><li>Price: $199</li></ul><br><h3>Best for pore retexturizing: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dermaflash Dermapore Ultrasonic Pore Extractor and Serum Infuser</a></h3><a class=affiliate-link-banner rel=nofollow href=#><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/44d947b07435c31260ca8e51d128033c/a1287/pmd-microderm-pro.png></span></a><p>If you’re looking to redefine the appearance of your skin’s texture as well as minimize the look of pores, this device can come in handy.
