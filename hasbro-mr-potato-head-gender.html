Even among younger consumers -- who tend to be more accepting of gender fluidity and conscious of brand values in general -- opinions on Potato Head’s name change were more negative than positive: 45 percent of millennials said they disagreed with Hasbro’s decision, compared with 30 percent who said they supported the move."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Mattel Inc.’s Barbie has expanded beyond its traditional female, white and blonde doll, creating its first gender-neutral dolls in September 2019 and adding accessories such as wheelchairs in recent years. American Girl, another brand owned by Mattel, added its first male doll to its lineup in 2017.</p><p class=mb-s>While Hasbro’s decision didn’t please everyone, it garnered some positive feedback from organizations such as GLAAD.</p><p class=mb-s>“Hasbro’s decision to introduce Potato Head as a gender-neutral toy is the latest move in a larger movement towards greater diversity and inclusion in toys and media aimed at kids,” said Chief Communications Officer Rich Ferraro in a statement to Morning Consult. “By offering a toy that exists outside of the binary of male and female, Hasbro is helping kids to simply see toys as toys, which encourages them to be their authentic selves outside of the pressures of traditional gender norms.”</p><p class=mb-s>The strongest disapproval came from Republicans: Members of the GOP were about as likely to disapprove of the Hasbro decision as they were to <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer text-primary hover:underline" tabindex=0 href=#>disapprove</a> of President Joe Biden’s performance as commander-in-chief. Even Democrats were evenly split in their opinions.</p><p class=mb-s>Some political figures didn’t hesitate to weigh in on the Potato Head rebrand.</p><p class=mb-s>Donald Trump Jr. predicted the controversy would lead to a “non binary potato” after Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) applauded the brand on Twitter for its clarification that the individual toys will still be known as Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, a statement he interpreted as Hasbro “recognizing there’s only 2 genders.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX52utK7RqGSmql2lvLWt06hkoZ2RmXqosc2dnKs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
