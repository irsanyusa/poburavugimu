It’s because of&nbsp;thermals. Thermal is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;big bubble of&nbsp;warm air that rises up&nbsp;from the ground. Have you ever flown a&nbsp;kite on&nbsp;a&nbsp;windy day and watched it&nbsp;go&nbsp;up&nbsp;and down? Imagine if&nbsp;the wind was warm instead of&nbsp;cold, and instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;kite, you were a&nbsp;bird or&nbsp;a&nbsp;glider. So&nbsp;yeah, that warm wind would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;thermal!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7fe/711/32b304590597c45420876ac137.png><p>Thermals occur when the <a href=# title=sun data-link=tag>sun</a> heats up&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Earth data-link=tag>Earth</a>, and the air close to&nbsp;the ground gets warm and starts to&nbsp;rise. This creates a&nbsp;column of&nbsp;rising air that birds and gliders can ride on&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;up&nbsp;into the sky. Just like how you can use the wind to&nbsp;fly a&nbsp;kite, birds can use thermals to&nbsp;soar without flapping their wings too much. They can circle inside the thermal and go&nbsp;higher and higher without using up&nbsp;too much <a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a>.</p><p>Those that especially tend to&nbsp;use this “flying in&nbsp;circles” mode are large raptors such as&nbsp;hawks, vultures, and eagles. When these birds circle in&nbsp;the sky, it&nbsp;looks like they are just hanging there, but nope&nbsp;— it’s all about thermals again. It&nbsp;helps them because as&nbsp;they go&nbsp;higher without getting tired, they can look for food more easily or&nbsp;watch out for predators from a&nbsp;good position in&nbsp;the sky. Thermals are important for some other animals that fly too, like insects. You may see lots of&nbsp;birds flying in&nbsp;circles together. Sticking together helps them save even more energy. Some birds, like geese and ducks, tend to&nbsp;fly in&nbsp;a&nbsp;V formation to&nbsp;save their strength. What’s interesting is&nbsp;that all the birds in&nbsp;the flock take turns leading the V! As&nbsp;they fly, the birds at&nbsp;the front get tired, so&nbsp;they fall back, and another bird takes their place as&nbsp;the leader. This way, every bird gets a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;rest and save energy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f39/552/43320556d3819b1d57302ae5fb.png><p>Thermals can also create powerful storms like thunderstorms. And sometimes when you see birds flying in&nbsp;circles or&nbsp;a&nbsp;V shape&nbsp;— it’s because they sense a&nbsp;storm is&nbsp;coming. This happens because bad weather comes hand in&nbsp;hand with low pressure. Low-pressure systems are areas in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=atmosphere data-link=tag>atmosphere</a> where the air pressure is&nbsp;lower than the surrounding areas. When the pressure drops, it&nbsp;can cause the air to&nbsp;move and create wind. If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;enough moisture in&nbsp;the air, the low pressure can even cause thunderstorms, heavy rain, or&nbsp;even hurricanes. Migratory birds are often those who use their keen sense of&nbsp;hearing and vision to&nbsp;detect changes in&nbsp;weather conditions. When a&nbsp;storm is&nbsp;approaching, there can be&nbsp;changes in&nbsp;air pressure, wind speed, and temperature, which can affect their behavior. Some other animals have interesting types of&nbsp;behavior when the bad weather is&nbsp;coming too.</p><p>Cows and other livestock may huddle together in&nbsp;a&nbsp;group for warmth and protection during a&nbsp;storm. Also, cows are known to&nbsp;lie down in&nbsp;a&nbsp;field before a&nbsp;storm as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;ease this discomfort. Or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least that may be&nbsp;something you’ve heard. (What have you heard about this herd?) The belief is&nbsp;that cows predict the weather and lie down because they can feel a&nbsp;drop in&nbsp;air pressure that comes with an&nbsp;approaching storm. But science hasn’t confirmed it&nbsp;yet since there’s not enough evidence to&nbsp;support this idea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/84b/3ae/1a1dcd530eaae1adbc3e6264eb.png><p>Cows DO&nbsp;like to&nbsp;lie down from time to&nbsp;time, but they do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;reasons, such as&nbsp;to&nbsp;rest or&nbsp;ruminate. So&nbsp;when you see one lying down, you can’t be&nbsp;sure it’s because bad weather is&nbsp;coming. Different studies showed different results&nbsp;— one found out cows didn’t show any significant changes in&nbsp;behavior before the rain, while another study found that cows stood up&nbsp;more often as&nbsp;the rain was coming. (Apparently, no&nbsp;one has actually asked the cows about this, but the cows aren’t talking, which is&nbsp;why this point is&nbsp;mooooot. )</p><p>Amphibians, such as&nbsp;frogs and toads, can give&nbsp;us information about natural phenomena. When you hear frogs croaking louder and longer than usual, it&nbsp;might indicate that a&nbsp;storm is&nbsp;approaching. Frogs are sensitive to&nbsp;changes in&nbsp;humidity and air pressure, and they tend to&nbsp;become more active and vocal just before a&nbsp;storm. And when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;toads, research says they might even predict earthquakes. This is&nbsp;because, before an&nbsp;earthquake, there are changes in&nbsp;the chemistry of&nbsp;the ponds where toads live. The shifts in&nbsp;the ground cause these changes, which in&nbsp;turn causes the toads to&nbsp;flee their homes. Scientists believe we&nbsp;should study these patterns to&nbsp;predict earthquakes more accurately. Dogs can sense storms and thunder too. They feel changes in&nbsp;the air pressure in&nbsp;the atmosphere, plus they have a&nbsp;way better sense of&nbsp;hearing and smell than humans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cce/434/db81715908a8d71255fb59eb16.png><p>When a&nbsp;storm is&nbsp;approaching, you can spot certain things in&nbsp;their behavior. For instance, they may become more restless or&nbsp;clingy, they may pant excessively or&nbsp;pace back and forth, and they may try to&nbsp;hide in&nbsp;a&nbsp;safe place. This is&nbsp;because dogs can feel the static electricity that builds up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the air before a&nbsp;storm, and they may become anxious or&nbsp;frightened by&nbsp;the loud noises and bright flashes of&nbsp;lightning.</p><p>There were stories that dogs can predict earthquakes too, but there’s no&nbsp;firm evidence of&nbsp;that. But who cares, dogs are our heroes even without that! Honeybees can sense changes in&nbsp;pressure and humidity levels as&nbsp;well&nbsp;— so&nbsp;they use this information to&nbsp;predict when a&nbsp;storm is&nbsp;coming. Bees are social insects that live in&nbsp;large groups in&nbsp;hives or&nbsp;colonies. That’s why predicting weather is&nbsp;so&nbsp;important for them&nbsp;— they need to&nbsp;protect their hives and forage for food before the storm hits. So&nbsp;for bees, bad weather may come like a&nbsp;real vacation they’ve wanted for so&nbsp;long&nbsp;— just some chillin’ and eating all the food they gathered before. Just like me&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sense.</p><p>Spiders have superpowers when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;weather too. Well, they can’t exactly predict the weather, but their behavior can give&nbsp;us a&nbsp;clue about the temperature outside. When it’s going to&nbsp;get colder, spiders might seek <a href=# title=shelter data-link=tag>shelter</a> indoors. So, if&nbsp;you see many spiders in&nbsp;your home, it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign that colder weather is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the way. You may have heard snakes can predict earthquakes. The legend where this belief started actually dates back to&nbsp;373 B.C.E. when snakes and other creatures are said to&nbsp;have left the area before a&nbsp;major earthquake in&nbsp;Greece. Cool story, but there’s little firm evidence to&nbsp;support this theory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/55c/341/7930a15f0788dcfe8e4a57b0a6.png><p>Scientists DO&nbsp;acknowledge that snakes and other animals can sense earthquakes a&nbsp;few seconds before people do&nbsp;because they can feel the initial wave better. But it’s still not clear if&nbsp;they can detect it&nbsp;days in&nbsp;advance. How about sheep and their “sixth sense”? It&nbsp;allows them to&nbsp;predict rain or&nbsp;snow. They huddle together tightly before a&nbsp;storm, which could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;keep warm or&nbsp;protect themselves from the weather. But this theory needs to&nbsp;yet be&nbsp;appropriately tested and proven. Baaa!</p><p>You will hear wolves howling during big storms as&nbsp;well. Many people think wolves do&nbsp;it&nbsp;when a&nbsp;full moon is&nbsp;outside. But some experts believe the change in&nbsp;air pressure that comes with a&nbsp;big storm may cause discomfort in&nbsp;sensitive canine ears&nbsp;— and this is&nbsp;what makes them howl. But again, it’s hard to&nbsp;tell precisely because wolves howl for many reasons. They do&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;signal danger, attract a&nbsp;mate and communicate with their pack. There’s also no&nbsp;evidence the full Moon fascinates them so&nbsp;much that they feel the urge to&nbsp;howl when they see&nbsp;it. But it’s good for the movies though. Sharks have ears sensitive to&nbsp;changes in&nbsp;air and water pressure that usually occur during hurricanes and tropical storms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c37/3d8/0efec651e18a9e7637604bb12b.png><p>Some experts believe they can detect these and quickly dive into deeper waters to&nbsp;stay safe. Studies showed sharks behaved like this many times before storms. Again, no&nbsp;one’s sure 100% about this, but like many other animals, they&nbsp;DO have a&nbsp;special ability to&nbsp;detect changes in&nbsp;their environment and use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;survive and thrive over time.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpsc1msKitXaiypnnToaCsZZmjerW0xGaqpLFdqa6ssYycpq%2BdomK2rrnEnaCarJWhxm6EkG5nam9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
