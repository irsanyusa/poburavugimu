In addition to interest rates, it’s important to consider any fees associated with the account to ensure you don’t lose a big chunk of your earned interest.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-a-money-market-account>How to choose a money market account</h2><p>When picking a money market account, it’s important to look at several factors. Most important, consider the following rates, fees, and account features:</p><ul><li><a rel=alternate href=#>Annual percentage yield</a>: Annual percentage yield, commonly abbreviated as APY, measures how much you earn from your deposit. APY enables you to make an apples-to-apples comparison between accounts. A higher APY means you earn more interest.</li><li>Minimum balance requirements: Depending on your bank or credit union, you may find a minimum opening balance requirement and a minimum balance requirement to avoid monthly recurring fees. Every dollar in fees takes away from your earnings.</li><li>Other fees: While less typical of money market accounts, some fees apply to less common activities. Before signing up for any financial account, thoroughly review the fee schedule so you don’t run into any surprises.</li><li>Convenience for your banking preferences: If you only want a bank with physical branch locations nearby, membership in the Zelle network for free, instant transfers, or any other specific preferences, you may have to shop around to find the right account with a combination of features ideal for your needs.</li></ul><p>You may have found a winner if you find an account that meets your requirements given the above criteria.</p><h2 id=alternatives-to-mmas>Alternatives to MMAs</h2><h3>Money market accounts vs. savings accounts</h3><p>Traditional savings accounts don’t offer check writing. Many savings and money market accounts offer similar features, such as FDIC or NCUA insurance and a limit of six monthly withdrawals. Note however, that limiting withdrawals to six is no longer mandated.Regulation D, the federal rule that required this, was <a rel=nofollow href=#>withdrawn by the Federal Reserve Board</a> in 2020. You can find accounts that won’t limit how often you can take out funds. <a rel=alternate href=#>High-yield savings accounts</a> often feature among the top interest rates at a bank or credit union. They typically don’t have the check-writing features of a money market account.</p><h3>Money market accounts vs. CDs</h3><p>Certificates of deposit offer a <a rel=alternate href=#>fixed interest rate</a> for a specific period. You may be able to lock in a higher interest rate than other savings products, but you’ll generally have to pay a penalty if you need to access funds before the maturity date.</p><h2 id=more-on-money-market-accounts>More on money market accounts</h2><h3>What is a money market account?</h3><p>A money market account is an interest-bearing savings product offer by a bank or credit union account. MMAs typically yield higher savings than regular savings account. Money market accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Association (NCUA) up to $250,000 per account holder. Today's national average APY is 0.58% (source: Curinos, updated as at January 26, 2024).</p><h3>Pros & cons of MMAs</h3><h3 class=title>Pros:</h3><ul><li>Higher interest rates</li><li>More withdrawal options</li></ul><h3 class=title>Cons:</h3><ul><li>Some financial institutions can impose withdrawal fees</li><li>Minimum balance requirements (subject to fees)</li><li>Lower returns compared to other investment tools</li></ul><h3>How to open a money market account</h3><p>You can open a money market account in person or online. You will need the following information to open your account regardless of which method you choose:</p><ul><li>Name, address, Social Security number, employment status, income</li><li>Government ID with photo</li><li>Routing number and account number of the account you are using to fund your MMA</li><li>Cash or check to fund the account if you open at a branch</li></ul><h3>Why should you open a money market account?</h3><p>A money market account is a good option for consumers who want to accrue a higher interest rate on their savings and who also need quicker access to their money. Withdrawl options come in various ways including paper checks and debit cards. These types of accounts are ideal to reach goal achievement such as paying for college tuition, saving for a wedding, funding home improvements, or saving for a car.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><p>You may encounter these common questions when shopping for a money market account.</p><h3>Are money market accounts a good investment?</h3><p>Money market accounts are a form of government-insured savings account. With a balance of up to $250,000 for individual accounts or $500,000 for joint accounts, you can save effectively risk-free.

You can use APY to compare the return from either account.</p><h3>Are MMAs taxed?</h3><p>The IRS considers interest earned from money market accounts taxable income in most situations.
