Some dancers combined their talent with acrobatics, projections, and lights. Others ore elaborate costumes or performed on dramatic sets. Let’s take a look at the best of the best.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-best-dance-acts-on-america-s-got-talent>The Best Dance Acts on ‘America’s Got Talent’</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>1. Kenichi Ebina</h2><p>This Japanese dancer competed on Season 8 of AGT. He auditioned with a routine inspired by The Matrix, in which he moved his body like a machine and even seemed to make his own head fall off. The audience went wild for Kenichi’s seemingly impossible moves, and he ended up winning the entire competition. He later returned to compete in AGT: The Champions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. V.Unbeatable</h2><p>This acrobatic dance group from India stunned the judges in Season 14 with their gravity-defying moves. They earned a Golden Buzzer from guest judge Dwyane Wade in the Judge Cuts, and they ended up making it to the Finals, although they didn’t win. V.Unbeatable later returned for the second season of AGT: The Champions, where they were named the winners.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Light Balance</h2><p>In Season 12, this light-up dance crew from Ukraine showed America a new kind of performance. The dancers wore light-up costumes and created colorful stories on stage with each performance. They finished the competition in third place and later returned for AGT: The Champions. A younger version of the group, called Light Balance Kids, made it to the Finals of Season 14.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8Ecz_sntDo</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Zurcaroh</h2><p>This acrobatic dance group, originally founded in Brazil, competed in Season 13 of AGT, earning the Golden Buzzer from host Tyra Banks. They showed off some dramatic and awe-inspiring routines throughout the competition, featuring themed costumes and sets. The group ended up finishing the season in second place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Diavolo</h2><p>This dance group, led by Jacques Heim, competed on Season 12 of the show. Their graceful audition routine had the judges and audience gasping, as the dancers performed on a large rocking structure. They used similar props, including stairs and wheels, in future performances, taking them all the way to the Finals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agKoMdnyNtk</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. Freckled Sky</h2><p>This video projection dance act competed in Season 10 of AGT. It was founded by Val Syganevich and featured dancers Jalen Preston and Olga Sokolova. In their audition, they performed against projected elements to create a story. Freckled Sky made it to the Quarterfinals, and the act returned in AGT: The Champions with two new dancers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOtqbAxRkyM</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. W.A.F.F.L.E. Crew</h2><p>This dance group (whose name stands for We Are Family For Life Entertainment) competed in Season 15 of the show, earning a Golden Buzzer from Simon Cowell in their audition. Later in the competition, they actually performed on a subway set, interacting with the environment. The group made it to the Semifinals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Vs5dR52cw</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8.
