The New York Times Crossword first featured the word “meme” in&nbsp;1953 with the clue “Same: French.” Its latest appearance was on&nbsp;Dec.&nbsp;24, 2021, with the clue “Something that gets passed around a&nbsp;lot.”</p><p><strong>Memes, according to&nbsp;Professor Conrod, have been a&nbsp;means of&nbsp;<a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> for as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;humans have used any symbolic system.</strong> D.&nbsp;Andrew Price, the head of&nbsp;content at&nbsp;Memes.com, echoed this sentiment, asserting that Dawkins merely “coined the term for something that’s existed literally forever.” Price described a&nbsp;meme as&nbsp;an&nbsp;idea that swiftly permeates public awareness.</p><p><strong>The French word “même” means “same,” and in&nbsp;Greek, “mimoúmai” translates to&nbsp;“to&nbsp;imitate.”</strong> In&nbsp;his book, Richard Dawkins sought a&nbsp;term for the new replicator—a word that captures the idea of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cultural transmission unit or&nbsp;a&nbsp;unit of&nbsp;imitation. Dawkins aimed for a&nbsp;one-syllable term resembling “gene” and considered its potential connection to&nbsp;“memory” or&nbsp;the French word “même.”</p><p>According to&nbsp;Dawkins, a&nbsp;meme could be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;unit related to&nbsp;memory or&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>French term</a> “même.” Webster’s New World College Dictionary <strong>defines a&nbsp;meme as&nbsp;“a&nbsp;concept, belief, or&nbsp;practice conceived as&nbsp;a&nbsp;unit of&nbsp;cultural information that may be&nbsp;passed on&nbsp;from person to&nbsp;person, subject to&nbsp;influences in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way analogous to&nbsp;natural selection.”</strong></p><p>In&nbsp;essence, a&nbsp;meme is&nbsp;like an&nbsp;idea, belief, or&nbsp;practice that acts as&nbsp;a&nbsp;unit of&nbsp;cultural information, passing from one person to&nbsp;another, influenced by&nbsp;factors similar to&nbsp;natural selection.</p><p><h2>However, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the Internet we&nbsp;associate memes the most with.</h2></p><p>An&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Internet meme</a>, also known simply as&nbsp;a&nbsp;meme, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;culture like an&nbsp;idea, behavior, or&nbsp;style that spreads on&nbsp;the Internet, especially on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a>. <strong>Memes come in&nbsp;different types, such as&nbsp;pictures, videos, GIFs, and other things that become popular quickly. </strong>Memes are known for being easy to&nbsp;make fun&nbsp;of, using references to&nbsp;other things, spreading rapidly like a&nbsp;virus, and changing over time.</p><p>In&nbsp;1993, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mike Godwin</a> named it&nbsp;an&nbsp;Internet meme and talked about how memes spread on&nbsp;message boards, Usenet groups, and through email. As&nbsp;social <a href=# title=media data-link=tag>media</a> like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram grew, memes became more varied and could spread fast. <strong>New types of&nbsp;memes, like “dank” and surreal ones, and short videos on&nbsp;platforms like Vine and <a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a>, have become popular.</strong></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Memes</a> are a&nbsp;big part of&nbsp;Internet culture and are studied seriously. They show up&nbsp;in&nbsp;many areas, such as&nbsp;marketing, economics, finance, social movements, and healthcare. Even though some people think memes should be&nbsp;protected as&nbsp;fair use, using content from existing works can sometimes cause problems with copyright.</p><p><strong>Memes, in&nbsp;essence, are like little bits of&nbsp;culture that travel around the Internet and change as&nbsp;they&nbsp;go. They are fun, quick, and can be&nbsp;about anything!</strong></p><p><h2>The meaning of&nbsp;the word “meme” has changed significantly with time.</h2></p><p>The term “meme” has undergone a&nbsp;change in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>meaning</a> over time, much like many other words in&nbsp;the English language. Jennifer Nycz, an&nbsp;associate professor and director of&nbsp;undergraduate studies at&nbsp;Georgetown University’s Department of&nbsp;Linguistics, explains that in&nbsp;today’s Internet-driven world, <strong>“memes and their meanings are co-constructed by&nbsp;multiple users in&nbsp;a&nbsp;social context.”</strong></p><p>According to&nbsp;her, this process of&nbsp;communication and knowledge creation is&nbsp;not fundamentally different from other forms; it&nbsp;just stands out more with memes because people deliberately create and share them for public commentary.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Saint Hoax</a>, a&nbsp;popular meme creator with three million Instagram followers, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>defines</a> a&nbsp;meme as&nbsp;a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;media repurposed to&nbsp;convey cultural, social, or&nbsp;political expressions, often through humor. <strong>According to&nbsp;Saint Hoax, memes have the unique ability to&nbsp;capture insights in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that perfectly aligns with the current cultural climate.</strong></p><p>Moreover, memes play a&nbsp;significant role in&nbsp;boosting the popularity of&nbsp;various forms of&nbsp;<a href=# title=entertainment data-link=tag>entertainment</a>. Samantha Sage, co-founder and chief creative officer of&nbsp;Betches, a&nbsp;media company targeting millennial women, notes that memes can propel new&nbsp;TV shows or&nbsp;songs to&nbsp;fame by&nbsp;becoming the foundation of&nbsp;viral trends. In&nbsp;this way, memes have evolved beyond simple jokes to&nbsp;become powerful tools for cultural expression and trendsetting.</p><p><h2>We&nbsp;witness meme trends every year, and some of&nbsp;them become truly iconic!</h2></p><p>The early 2000s witnessed the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dawn of&nbsp;memes</a>, with the classic top text/bottom text on&nbsp;images emerging as&nbsp;the first contenders. During this period, creating memes was less sophisticated due to&nbsp;limited tools. <strong>Memes like </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i><strong>One does not simply</strong></i></a><strong> or&nbsp;the </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i><strong>Velociraptor</strong></i></a><strong> meme gained popularity, embodying the simplicity of&nbsp;the era. Another trend was </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i><strong>rage comics</strong></i></a><strong>, three-panel comics often featuring the notorious troll face reacting to&nbsp;situations, such as&nbsp;gaming mishaps.</strong> These comics, created using Microsoft Paint, allowed more people to&nbsp;modify or&nbsp;replicate them easily.</p><p>The meme landscape experienced a&nbsp;significant shift in&nbsp;2007 when YouTube popularized the video meme format. Memes like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Rickrolling</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Chocolate Rain</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Numa Numa</i></a>, and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Harlem Shake</i></a> gained attention, contributing to&nbsp;the widespread popularity of&nbsp;meme culture.</p><p>A&nbsp;short-lived yet impactful social media app called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Vine</a>, which emerged as&nbsp;a&nbsp;major player in&nbsp;the meme scene, brought the short video format to&nbsp;the forefront. <strong>Memes like </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i><strong>What are those</strong></i></a><strong>, and </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i><strong>Iridocyclitis</strong></i></a><strong> became viral sensations.</strong> Though Vine had a&nbsp;brief existence, it&nbsp;paved the way for the evolution of&nbsp;memes.</p><p>Today, platforms like TikTok have amalgamated the best of&nbsp;Vine and YouTube, offering a&nbsp;new and expansive arena for spreading humor. The combination of&nbsp;short videos and creative content on&nbsp;TikTok has redefined the way memes are shared and enjoyed in&nbsp;the current digital landscape.</p><p>The landscape of&nbsp;memes has undergone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>significant transformations</a> since its inception. A&nbsp;striking example is&nbsp;the contrast between earlier memes like rage comics. <strong>Rage comics followed a&nbsp;structured narrative with a&nbsp;beginning, middle, and end, while Harambe emerged as&nbsp;a&nbsp;meme following the controversy surrounding the death of&nbsp;a&nbsp;gorilla, showcasing the evolving nature of&nbsp;meme content.</strong></p><p><strong>Certain phrases have become integral to&nbsp;the vocabulary of&nbsp;the younger generation, such as&nbsp;“Bruh” or&nbsp;“Bruh moment.”</strong> “Bruh,” a&nbsp;shortened form of&nbsp;“brother,” is&nbsp;commonly used to&nbsp;express surprise or&nbsp;disappointment when something absurd occurs. An&nbsp;instance of&nbsp;a&nbsp;“bruh moment” might&nbsp;be, “When your wife’s boyfriend doesn’t let you sleep with her.” <strong>The term “Oof,” originating from the sound effect in&nbsp;the game Roblox when a&nbsp;character disappears, had a&nbsp;brief yet impactful presence, often used humorously when someone made a&nbsp;mistake.</strong></p><p>Trends like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>T-Posing</i></a> involve <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>standing upright</a>, ideally above someone, with arms forming a&nbsp;T shape to&nbsp;assert dominance. The year 2020 itself is&nbsp;often humorously regarded as&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant meme due to&nbsp;unprecedented events, like extended periods of&nbsp;isolation. Amidst the boredom, games like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Among Us</i></a>&nbsp;gained immense popularity, turning into memes in&nbsp;their own right.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Karen memes</strong></a><strong>, depicting individuals exhibiting entitled and unreasonable behavior, witnessed a&nbsp;surge in&nbsp;popularity. These memes often portray instances where individuals resist wearing masks or&nbsp;engage in&nbsp;inappropriate behavior, highlighting societal issues and generating both amusement and critique.</strong></p><p>Memes, however, are not universally embraced, as&nbsp;some may find certain memes offensive. The diverse nature of&nbsp;the Internet, with its myriad people and content, ensures that memes will continually evolve. The future of&nbsp;memes, ten years from now, remains uncertain and will unfold with the passage of&nbsp;time.</p><p><h2>Memes now influence business, too.</h2></p><p><strong>The application of&nbsp;memes in&nbsp;promoting products or&nbsp;services has given rise to&nbsp;the term “</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>memetic marketing</strong></a><strong>.” </strong>This approach leverages Internet memes to&nbsp;make advertisements more engaging and less intrusive, tailoring them to&nbsp;the preferences of&nbsp;the target audience. Marketing professionals can opt to&nbsp;use existing memes or&nbsp;create new ones from scratch.</p><p><strong>Gucci, a&nbsp;prominent fashion brand, chose the former method, incorporating its watch collection into a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;Instagram ads that reimagined popular memes.</strong> Conversely, the meme “The Most Interesting Man in&nbsp;the World” emerged from an&nbsp;advertising campaign for Dos Equis beverages, showcasing the versatility of&nbsp;meme creation in&nbsp;marketing.</p><p>The concept of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>meme stocks</a> has gained prominence, signifying instances where the value of&nbsp;a&nbsp;company’s stocks experiences a&nbsp;rapid and substantial increase in&nbsp;a&nbsp;short span, propelled by&nbsp;heightened online interest and subsequent buying activities by&nbsp;investors. GameStop, a&nbsp;video game retailer, stands out as&nbsp;the pioneering meme stock, marking the inception of&nbsp;this phenomenon.</p><p><strong>The year 2021 witnessed the noteworthy involvement of&nbsp;/r/WallStreetBets, a&nbsp;subreddit dedicated to&nbsp;discussions on&nbsp;stock trading, and Robinhood Markets, a&nbsp;financial services company, in&nbsp;popularizing meme stocks. This period brought attention to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new breed of&nbsp;investors termed “YOLO investors”.</strong> These investors exhibit a&nbsp;lower aversion to&nbsp;risk in&nbsp;their financial ventures compared to&nbsp;their traditional counterparts.</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;fascinating twist, memes have also forged connections with the realm of&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>cryptocurrency</strong></a><strong>, giving rise to&nbsp;meme currencies like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Coin, and Pepe Coin.</strong> The development of&nbsp;these meme cryptocurrencies has sparked discussions drawing parallels between the value dynamics of&nbsp;memes and traditional monetary markets. This intersection of&nbsp;memes and cryptocurrency adds a&nbsp;layer of&nbsp;unpredictability and creativity to&nbsp;the financial landscape, with the potential to&nbsp;reshape how we&nbsp;perceive and engage with both memes and investments in&nbsp;the digital age.</p><p>But even if&nbsp;you are not a&nbsp;loan shark on&nbsp;a&nbsp;finance market, but just an&nbsp;office worker, you can still enjoy a&nbsp;fun Friday meme at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the corporate week!</p><p><h2>Nowadays, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;underestimate the memes influence on&nbsp;the society.</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Internet memes</a> wield significant influence as&nbsp;potent tools within social movements, contributing to&nbsp;the formation of&nbsp;collective identity and offering a&nbsp;platform for discourse. <strong>The utilization of&nbsp;memes in&nbsp;social movements becomes evident when examining specific instances such as&nbsp;the 2010&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>It Gets Better Project</strong></a><strong>, which focused on&nbsp;LGBTQ+ empowerment. </strong>Memes played a&nbsp;crucial role in&nbsp;this initiative, serving to&nbsp;inspire and uplift LGBTQ+ youth while simultaneously contributing to&nbsp;the negotiation of&nbsp;the community’s shared identity.</p><p>Another noteworthy example showcasing the impact of&nbsp;Internet memes on&nbsp;social causes is&nbsp;the 2014 Ice Bucket Challenge. This viral phenomenon effectively raised both funds and awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Through the widespread sharing of&nbsp;memes related to&nbsp;the Ice Bucket Challenge, the campaign succeeded in&nbsp;mobilizing support and disseminating information about ALS.</p><p>Additionally, Internet memes played a&nbsp;pivotal role in&nbsp;shaping the discourse surrounding the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement</a> in&nbsp;2011. <strong>Memes served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;dynamic and accessible means of&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>communication</strong></a><strong>, allowing participants and observers alike to&nbsp;engage in&nbsp;discussions and express opinions regarding the movement’s goals and messages.</strong></p><p>In&nbsp;essence, Internet memes have proven to&nbsp;be&nbsp;dynamic tools, not only fostering connectivity within social movements but also amplifying their impact by&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;shared narrative and facilitating conversations that extend beyond physical boundaries. The ability of&nbsp;memes to&nbsp;convey messages with brevity and humor enhances their effectiveness in&nbsp;engaging diverse audiences and fostering a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;community within various social causes.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about this Friday meme collection?
