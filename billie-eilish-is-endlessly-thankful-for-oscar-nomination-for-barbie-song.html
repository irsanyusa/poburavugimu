Despite critical acclaim for her committed performance as the iconic <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie</a>, Robbie was among several key snubs.</p><p>The nominations for the 96th Academy Awards were announced on Tuesday, with Eilish and her collaborator brother Finneas O’Connell grabbing a Best Original Song nomination. In a joint statement, the siblings conveyed their excitement.</p><p>“We are so incredibly honored to receive a nomination for ‘What Was I Made For?’ As lifelong fans of film, music in film, and the Academy Awards, this means everything to us,” they wrote.</p><p>Eilish and Finneas also expressed feeling “grateful to the Academy” and “recognized alongside so many songwriters that we respect and admire.”</p><p>The nod comes on the heels of their triumphant 2022 Oscar win for penning the James Bond theme song “No Time to Die.” At just age 20, Eilish became the youngest artist to win Best Original Song.</p><p>In their statement, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eilish</a> and Finneas made sure to highlight others instrumental to the success of their nominated Barbie track. They offered “deepest gratitude” to director Greta Gerwig and producer Robbie for their “genius vision” in bringing the film to life.</p><p>Additionally, they thanked the film’s music producers Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt for expertly incorporating the song into pivotal sequences. Eilish and Finneas also gave a “special shout out” to Robbie specifically for her brilliant acting performance that inspired their writing process.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-barbie-earns-multiple-oscar-nods-amidst-snubs>Barbie Earns Multiple Oscar Nods Amidst Snubs</h2><p>While Eilish’s song remains in Oscars contention, Barbie generally underperformed with the Academy compared to expectations. Along with shutouts for Robbie and Gerwig, the movie missed anticipated nods for Best Picture and Editing.</p><p>It did earn <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nominations</a> for Costume Design, Makeup/Hairstyling, and Production Design. Ryan Gosling also scored a Supporting Actor nomination for playing Ken. However, the limited recognition fell short of the film’s acclaimed craftsmanship.</p><p>Still, Eilish focuses positively on her own nomination as a career highlight. At just 22, she’s already a two-time Oscar nominee with a win under her belt. With numerous Grammys also on her resume, Eilish keeps achieving history-making moments through her music.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_JackieEvancho_Jason-MendezGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Jackie Evancho Performs Original Single “Behind My Eyes” on ‘Good Morning America’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waKjpaGVYrKquMisn2aho2Kyr7DLnqqspKliwamtzaSdrqRdm7yzec6smpqqXaO8rrXNmquip55is7C%2BjJuYq5qZmnq0u82gZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
