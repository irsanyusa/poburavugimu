Kara Ahern, who worked for Cheney during her brief bid against Republican Sen. Mike Enzi in 2014, is likely to manage her race this time around.</p><p>Efforts to reach Cheney spokespersons through the Alliance for a Strong America, a group she and her father formed in 2014 to advocate for a robust foreign policy, were unsuccessful.</p><p>Cheney won’t have the race to herself: At least six other Republicans are already running, including state Sen. Leland Christensen and state Rep. Tim Stubson.</p><p>Christensen, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee,&nbsp;<a href=#>has support from Lummis’ daughter</a>, Annaliese Wiederspahn; both he and Cheney hail from donor-rich Teton County, in Wyoming’s northwest corner. Stubson, the No. 3 Republican in the state House,&nbsp;<a href=#>is from Casper</a>.</p><p>The winner of the Aug. 16 primary is almost certain to win in November; Wyoming hasn’t sent a Democrat to the House since Teno Roncalio won his last race in 1976.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hha3xxfY5raGikma96pLTEp5yyZZOWurGtyKClZpuforavs4yspqimXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
