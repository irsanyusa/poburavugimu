 Although cardboard boxes are mainly used for storing or transporting various things and we do not pay much attention to them, they are an object of desire for cats.  More than one cat owner has noticed that their pet, despite having a soft bed or couch at their disposal, prefers an empty and uncomfortable-looking cardboard box."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It turns out that this need can be explained.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-5>Why do cats love cardboard boxes?</h2></p><p>Cats are happy to squeeze into cardboard boxes, even if they seem small and uncomfortable at first glance. This is because the limited space inside them gives them a sense of security.</p><p>When the need arises, a small area allows them to shut themselves off from the world and calm down the emotions that are starting to build up. A dark place is also a good material for a hideout and a safe place allows them to observe what is happening around them.</p><p>In addition, heat accumulates in a small box because cardboard insulates quite well, which may be another explanation for why cats often abandon a soft, comfortable sleeping place in favour of a cramped box.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>The matter was investigated by experts</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The value of cat boxes has been confirmed by research conducted by a team of scientists led by <strong>Claudia Vinke</strong>, a professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Researchers at an animal shelter selected 19 cats and divided them into two groups. Ten cats were given a box in their box, while the rest were not. What was the result of this study?</p><p>The animals that had the cardboard box in their kennel were much more relaxed than those that had to do without it. Their stress levels dropped much faster.</p><p>This article was originally published by <a href=# id=bdea8f43-0d0a-469e-beb2-d418f2696193 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Onet</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSpxYycmK2rXaG8t7GMnJirnJKkrrOwjJumsZ2jZLK1spKjpJw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
