In a series of Instagram stories, she answered some of her fans’ burning questions about their move, revealing exciting details that will surely leave her fans excited for her new journey.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-is-witney-carson-moving-to-florida>Why is Witney Carson Moving to Florida?</h2><p>Many fans were curious about her reasons for choosing Florida as her new home. According to her Instagram stories, Carson and her husband, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carson McAllister</a>, had been searching for a warm place to move to for about two years.</p><p>When her sister-in-law moved to Florida a year and a half ago, they fell in love with the area and its warm weather. They were attracted to the beauty and the lifestyle of Florida and its vast opportunities for outdoor activities. Apart from this, Carson also answered other questions regarding her move to a state with a drastic change in climate from their usually cold town in Utah.</p><p>When fans asked when they are planning to move, Carson revealed that they would not move until after their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">baby is born</a>, and they plan to leave as soon as she feels better, which will likely be in June. Despite June being the worst time of year to move to Florida because of the heat, they are still pushing through with their plans.</p><p>When asked if they would still come back to Utah, where their family is, Carson confirmed that they plan to go back and forth between Florida and Utah, especially since most of her family is based in Utah. One fan also asked if they were keeping their house in Utah, to which Carson confirmed that they were keeping their house as a “fail-safe” in case they ever decide to come back.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Will Witney Carson’s Move Affect Her Career?</h2><p>With her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">move to Florida</a>, many of her fans are wondering how this new adventure will impact her career. Fortunately, Carson has reassured her fans that her move will not affect her career as a dancer and choreographer.</p><p>In fact, she plans to continue working in the entertainment industry and has already started reaching out to connections in the area. This is great news for the fans who speculated that she won’t be competing in the upcoming season 32 of DWTS.</p><p>She’s currently focused on her family in the meantime, but with her expertise and experience as a professional dancer and choreographer, Carson could inspire and train aspiring dancers in Florida. With her passion for dance and her talent, she could help develop the next generation of dancers in Florida and beyond.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_XOMGPop_TraePattonNBC-1.jpg alt="XOMG POP Releases Debut Album ‘Party Like a POP STAR!’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuw8itpZ6xXZius7%2FOp2SesKChrqq60mafnqpdory3sYytpmaenKS%2FqrDAaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
