(Netflix UK & Ireland Summer 2023) <a title=matildamovie href=# rel=nofollow>#MatildaMovie</a> <a title=matildatok href=# rel=nofollow>#MatildaTok</a> <a title=fyp href=# rel=nofollow>#FYP</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Sony Pictures UK" href=# rel=nofollow>♬ original sound – Sony Pictures UK</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The catchy “Revolting Children” takes place as the children stage an uprising against their oppressive headmaster, the terrifying Miss Trunchbull. Kane, who spoke to Variety via Zoom in advance of the film’s Netflix premiere, says director Matthew Warchus wanted the sequence to feel explosive — “like a flood, like dams bursting,” she says. “It’s about revolution and kids finding their voice.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>How much did the choreography in the stage show inspire the movie?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">None of the choreography from the stage show is in the film. The film is completely new. I’ve always been a huge fan of classic movie musicals and getting the opportunity to use dance in a film like this, really front and center, was something I was super keen to do.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Were you involved in the dancers’ audition process?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Yes. For me, it’s really important to be present in making sure that every single child that came onto the project could get to this extraordinary level of storytelling through dance. We started [auditioning], and then the pandemic hit. We then continued that process by asking children to film themselves in their living room doing a minute of their favorite dance. And then we went through with my team again, looking at how the children might fit into the film. It was an extensive process.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>How many child dancers ended up in the movie?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">We ended up with almost 300 children in the film, but they all do very specific things.&nbsp;You can only work children a certain amount of hours. It’s actually not useful to be working them more than that. They get too tired, and it’s a lot for them to take in. So we had to have a lot of children in order to divide the work so it was manageable and challenging, but it wasn’t overwhelming.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>One number that’s really resonated with people is “Revolting Children,” and specifically the girl with the red beret. Can you talk me through that scene and what you wanted to achieve?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">That scene in the film starts with the character Bruce, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=URL data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL_j4XQhH8I">the boy that eats the cake</a>. But when we were discussing “Revolting Children,” I was super keen to split that song so we had a female and male child leading the revolution. It starts with Bruce actually opening Hortensia’s eyes up to that power, and she joins him. What we don’t see on all of those viral clips is that Bruce has his own corridor dance with his gang that he collects, and then she essentially answers with her corridor.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Matthew wanted that whole sequence to feel like a flood, like dams bursting. It’s about revolution and kids finding their voice. It’s about empowerment; essentially smashing down what was in order to create what will be.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>How did you approach the number from a technical standpoint?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">I was looking at parkour, and I saw some incredible performers. I said to Matthew, “Why don’t I try — I say ‘try’ quite literally — to make this sequence, which is a hybrid of dance with parkour, so it’s literally like they are smashing through the school, almost like a wrecking ball?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Initially when those children were coming down the hallway, I made that material have hockey sticks. She says a line before that, “Take out your hockey stick, and use it as a sword” so I thought it might be fun to see her gang coming with hockey sticks. It felt a bit too aggressive. I took it out. Once I settled and found the parkour coordinator, [he said] it would have been too dangerous. Already, people thought I was crazy. There’s a lot going on, and they’re doing that in real time. There’s nothing that’s sped up. There’s nothing that’s cheated. The precision and excellence of those children had to be rehearsed and tweaked so that the story and lyrics came across, but also that they were incredibly safe. And now it seems to be super popular.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>There’s so much movement in the background. Is there anything that audiences should pay attention to outside the center of the frame?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The clip that’s gone viral is Hortensia in the red beret. But once you go into the lobby, which is the huge space in the school, there are parkour kids front-somersaulting down huge flights of stairs. If you look above their heads, there are bars where there are children spinning and spinning and spinning. Then if you look on the staircase that is coming down to the lower level, there are children running and front-somersaulting over those banisters into the block. They’re doing that as kids are dancing around them.&nbsp;It’s incredible.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>What was your biggest choreography challenge?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">I could rehearse all of that stuff with their masks on. But I wasn’t allowed to [rehearse it] on film without their masks because of COVID regulations. I had to tape lines on the floor, which the children could not cross. They knew exactly what step they needed to stand on. They knew when they moved, and when they didn’t. When I came to shoot it, it had to be split up and then pasted together. That was an issue because if they were in the wrong place, they would disappear in the frame. And so when you look at it, you will think it was filmed at the same time, but it had to be pieced together because of COVID.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>What’s the biggest difference between working with kids versus adults?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The main difference with kids is you can’t change the material once you’ve taught it. It’s very hard for them to unlearn. I made mostly all of that [choreography] in workshops with adults and then when Matthew was happy with the work, we went about teaching children. My team would rehearse with the camera so they also understood what it was going to feel like when someone is in their way. Dance can sometimes lose its energy on film. I use the rehearsal process to be incredibly specific with them, incredibly detailed, to make sure the energy in every single frame is doing what I wanted it to do.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>What is the key to successfully bringing a Broadway show to the screen?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">What served me strong every time is to go back to the story and lyrics. I feel like I’ve honored dance in storytelling. Even though it might feel quite loud at times, it is explosive because it needs to be explosive. In “Revolting Children,” it’s a revolution. It has to feel like that.&nbsp;Once you start using dance as an accessory, it’s really easy to think that it’s not important in storytelling.
