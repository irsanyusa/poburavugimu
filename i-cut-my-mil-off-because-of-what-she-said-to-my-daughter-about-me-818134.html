She told what happened.
I (30 F) was in a car crash. I had to be cut out of the car. I wasn’t seriously injured though, thankfully, but the other person unfortunately wasn’t doing too well, from what I saw before I was taken away to the hospital. I was told to stay in the hospital overnight to see if I suffered from a concussion."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cut out of&nbsp;the car. I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wasn’t</a> seriously injured though, thankfully, but the other person unfortunately wasn’t doing too well, from what&nbsp;I saw before&nbsp;I was taken away to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>. I&nbsp;was told to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the hospital overnight to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;I suffered from a&nbsp;concussion. I&nbsp;rang my&nbsp;husband and told him what happened. My&nbsp;MIL got the incidents mixed up&nbsp;when he&nbsp;dropped off our daughters 6,11 to&nbsp;my&nbsp;MIL while he&nbsp;rushed to&nbsp;see&nbsp;me.</p><p>The next morning, my&nbsp;husband brought our daughters while&nbsp;I was waiting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;discharged. Upon seeing&nbsp;me, my&nbsp;6-year-old busted into tears and said, «I&nbsp;don’t want you to&nbsp;die.» I&nbsp;comforted her and said I’m not dying, and&nbsp;I was very lucky. She then said Granny said she hoped&nbsp;I die so&nbsp;that they and my&nbsp;husband could come live with her. My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I were shocked, and my&nbsp;12-year-old confirmed she heard her say that. My&nbsp;husband said he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;ring MIL.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9df/200/0f955958bea2683365a2f0d840.jpg><p>When he&nbsp;came back in&nbsp;the room, he&nbsp;looked furious. But didn’t say anything until after we&nbsp;got home, and he&nbsp;said that my&nbsp;MIL denied&nbsp;it, but after he&nbsp;kept pushing she ended up&nbsp;admitting&nbsp;it. She said she didn’t mean&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;thought we&nbsp;were close. But I&nbsp;guess not.</p><p>I&nbsp;am incredibly hurt that she would want that. I&nbsp;said&nbsp;I wanted me&nbsp;and the girls to&nbsp;have no&nbsp;contact with her. I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;husband that he&nbsp;could have a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with her, but&nbsp;I don’t want me&nbsp;and the girls to&nbsp;have one with her. My&nbsp;husband said he&nbsp;supports&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;then rang MIL and told her what I&nbsp;said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c6/7ef/b96fef50909886da1d601b91c7.jpg><p>She didn’t take it&nbsp;too well. She came to&nbsp;our house crying and saying it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;misunderstanding, she didn’t mean&nbsp;it, and that we&nbsp;were taking it&nbsp;the wrong way. My&nbsp;husband asked what did you mean then?</p><p>She just got hysterical and started crying and saying she always wanted daughters, but my&nbsp;husband was the only child due to&nbsp;her not being able to&nbsp;have anymore after him, and that the girls are more like her daughters than granddaughters. She said she wasn’t thinking properly when she said that to&nbsp;our 6-year-old. She got so&nbsp;worked up&nbsp;that my&nbsp;husband had to&nbsp;take her home.</p><p>When he&nbsp;got back he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;didn’t know she felt like that and asked if&nbsp;I still wanted to&nbsp;cut her off. I&nbsp;said yes! He&nbsp;said okay and didn’t argue. But it’s been a&nbsp;week now, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;still very quiet and hasn’t said much about what happened, and now I’m starting to&nbsp;feel guilty and wondering if&nbsp;I did take it&nbsp;the wrong way.</p><p><h2>People stood by&nbsp;her side</h2></p><ul><li>«She <a href=# title=traumatized data-link=tag>traumatized</a> your child. It&nbsp;was horrifying for your daughter to&nbsp;hear that. Stand your ground. She needs at&nbsp;the very least a&nbsp;good LONG time-out.<br>Do&nbsp;not let your husband or&nbsp;anyone sweep this under the rug because doing that would make everyone think it’s perfectly okay for MIL to&nbsp;hope you died, and for your daughters to&nbsp;lose their mom. That’s sickening!» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Laquila&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«You do&nbsp;realize that she basically told your husband that she didn’t want a&nbsp;boy.

I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband and asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was upset that&nbsp;I decided that me&nbsp;and the girls to&nbsp;have no&nbsp;contact with my&nbsp;MIL. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;wasn’t. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;always knew that his mom wanted a&nbsp;daughter instead of&nbsp;him, and it&nbsp;brought back all the bad memories of&nbsp;rejection and hurt he&nbsp;felt growing up&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid by&nbsp;her.</p><p>I&nbsp;suggested therapy and he’s willing to&nbsp;go. We&nbsp;are also going to&nbsp;get therapy for our 6-year-old, as&nbsp;she now gets <a href=# title=anxious data-link=tag>anxious</a> if&nbsp;I’m not within her sight.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband agreed that going without contact with my&nbsp;MIL&nbsp;is the best thing for our family. Our daughter’s birthday is&nbsp;coming&nbsp;up, and we&nbsp;have yet to&nbsp;tell her she is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer invited. Not looking forward to&nbsp;that.</p><p><h2>Followed by&nbsp;an&nbsp;unbelievable turn of&nbsp;events.</h2></p><p>I&nbsp;didn’t think&nbsp;I would be&nbsp;posting here again and thought my&nbsp;last update would be&nbsp;my&nbsp;last. But <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>here</a> we&nbsp;are. My&nbsp;MIL has been arrested. My&nbsp;husband’s cousin found my&nbsp;post and knew it&nbsp;was&nbsp;me, and she reported it&nbsp;straight to&nbsp;my&nbsp;MIL. She came over and screamed that we&nbsp;couldn’t keep her daughters away from her.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband tried to&nbsp;calm her down and get her to&nbsp;leave. She wouldn’t and attacked him. My&nbsp;husband had to&nbsp;restrain her and&nbsp;I called the police. She fought them, but it&nbsp;got her nowhere except the back of&nbsp;their car. The woman is&nbsp;truly insane.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband talked to&nbsp;the police because&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;calm down my&nbsp;daughters because they witnessed the whole thing. My&nbsp;6-year-old was hysterical about Granny being taken away. This is&nbsp;all just a&nbsp;big mess.</p><p><h2>Luckily, she had everyone’s back.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/462/6f1/05cacc572eb25bf6917aa9262b.jpg><ul><li>«I&nbsp;feel so&nbsp;bad for your husband, like, how incredibly upsetting.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Koalabootie&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«Make sure you press charges and file a&nbsp;restraining order.

However, when a&nbsp;boundary is&nbsp;crossed that undermines the integrity of&nbsp;the parent-child relationship and causes emotional harm, it&nbsp;becomes necessary to&nbsp;prioritize the well-being and protection of&nbsp;one’s family unit. Moving forward, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;essential to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;nurturing positive and supportive relationships within the family, while also maintaining firm boundaries to&nbsp;safeguard against further harm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZur9StZKaxXaK2rXnOn51mmpWYrra%2FxGamn2Wnna61edKhnGarkZ6xbsDOZqSyZZSWwqi0056pZpmSpMK1ecyeZHFpaGaAdXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
